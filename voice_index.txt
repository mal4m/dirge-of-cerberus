event/scene/ev0100/sound/10109v2.at2   What's going on?
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10109vn.at2   Huh?
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10110sk.at2   Found you.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10201vn.at2   Now where am I supposed to meet Reeve?
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10301vn.at2   [Galian Beast]
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10302vn.at2   [Galian Beast]
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10401sk.at2   Vincent Valentine.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10402sk.at2   We've found you.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10403az.at2   Is this the one?
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10404sk.at2   Yes.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10406sk.at2   The Protomateria.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10408sk.at2   Tell us where it is.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10409az.at2   Hail Weiss.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10410wl.at2   Hail Weiss!
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10501az.at2   Challenge accepted.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10502sk.at2   [weak effort]
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10503az.at2   Luck is on your side.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10504sk.at2   I'm sorry.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10505az.at2   I am Azul. We will meet again.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10506rv.at2   Vincent Valentine!
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10507rv.at2   Are you alright?
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10508vn.at2   Mhm
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10509vn.at2   Reeve, nice to see you again. Not a very interesting outfit, though.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10510rv.at2   It took me a while to decide which costume I'd put on for today.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10511rv.at2   But enough of the small talk. Who were those soldiers that just left?
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10512vn.at2   I don't know. The large one called himself Azul.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10513rv.at2   Azul the Cerulean? Of the Tsviets!?
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10514rv.at2   Then that could only mean...
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10515wh.at2   Commissioner!
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10516rv.at2   We'll discuss this later.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10517rv.at2   WRO troops have arrived and commenced rescue operations. We could use your help, Vincent.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10518vn.at2   Reeve.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10519rv.at2   Hm?
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10520vn.at2   I don't know what you are up to, but I want absolutely no part of it.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10521rv.at2   But... You fought alongside us three years ago! We need your help once mor--
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10522vn.at2   Reeve!
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10523ct.at2   That was a close one! Never was good at fighting. Luckily, I came out wearing "Reeve."
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10524ct.at2   You're really not a bad bloke, are you, Vincent? You pretend not to care, but you always come through in the end.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10525vn.at2   Alright, what do you want me to do?
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10526ct.at2   Let's run those lads outta town.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10527ct.at2   I'll leave the method up to you. When you've tidied things up,
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10528ct.at2   meet me at the square in front of the east church.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10529rv.at2   This way!
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10530rv.at2   What happened here?
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10601wr.at2   Mister Vincent Valentine.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10602wr.at2   I'm an officer with the World Regenesis Organization. Speak with me if you require any assistance.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10603wr.at2   Sir!
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10604wr.at2   The WRO was originally established three years ago, after Meteorfall. With Jenova War hero Reeve Tuesti at its helm, our organization is dedicated to aiding the healing process of the planet, as well as protecting it from any who attempt further harm.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10605wr.at2   Proceed to the East Church, just past these buildings.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10606wr.at2   Hurry! We will assist you in securing the area!
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10607fm.at2   [Mother and child crying, panicking]
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10608fm.at2   No! [Mother and child crying, panicking]
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10609fm.at2   No! Rio! No, don't take my baby!

event/scene/ev0100/sound/10701rv.at2   Good work, Vincent.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10702rv.at2   The enemy is retreating. It seems they have finally begun their withdrawal from Kalm.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10703vn.at2   Good.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10704rv.at2   However, we still require your assistance.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/10705rv.at2   Reports are Edge is under attack.

event/scene/ev0100/sound/11001l1.at2   Are... are they still out there?
event/scene/ev0100/sound/11002vn.at2   No. Not anymore.
event/scene/ev0100/sound/11003l1.at2   Alright...
event/scene/ev0100/sound/11004l1.at2   C'mon!

event/scene/ev0180/sound/10811rs.at2   The mighty WRO... They wouldn't last a day in Deepground.

event/scene/ev0200: WRO TRANSPORT - OUTSIDE EDGE
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20101vn.at2   Reeve. Who were those men?
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20102rv.at2   Deepground soldiers.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20103vn.at2   Deepground?
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20104rv.at2   Yes. The shadow of the Shinra Company, constructed by the former president and completely hidden from the rest of the world.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20105vn.at2   Constructed?
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20106rv.at2   His goal was to create an army of superhuman warriors--not once letting morality interfere.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20107rv.at2   The man you met earlier, Azul, is also a member of Deepground. But, he belongs to an elite unit known as the Tsviets.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20108rv.at2   The whole organization was kept a secret. That is why there is so little information on them. However, it's nothing like I expected.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20109vn.at2   Not even a person in your position was informed?
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20110rv.at2   No. Other than the president himself, the only people who knew of Deepground's existence were most likely Heidegger, Scarlet, and the head of biochemical research, Hojo.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20111rv.at2   After the president's death, the transfer of power to his son was carried out so quickly, I doubt Rufus was ever briefed on the project.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20112rv.at2   As for me, I was told the information was on a need to know basis. And as an official in charge of urban development, I guess I wasn't on their list.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20113rv.at2   All the intel we currently have on Deepground was only discovered recently when we came across some of Scarlet's old files.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20114rv.at2   [sigh]
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20115rv.at2   Vincent. Have you heard of the mass disappearance that occurred recently in Junon?
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20116vn.at2   I remember the report saying that 20 or 30 people suddenly vanished.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20117rv.at2   That's what the report would like you to believe.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20119rv.at2   It was determined internally that if the truth was leaked, they wouldn't be able to contain the inevitable panic.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20120rv.at2   The actual number of people that went missing that day was 1200.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20121vn.at2   Hm?
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20122rv.at2   1200 people simply vanished without a single trace.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20123rv.at2   The WRO conducted a private investigation but we came up empty-handed.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20124rv.at2   Except for the rumors.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20125rv.at2   Since the Junon disappearances, people in Edge have been on edge.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20126rv.at2   They say that night after night you can hear screams coming from the direction of Midgar.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20127rv.at2   Could it be the wind? Let me ask you, does the wind sound like a thousand wailing souls?
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20128rv.at2   Listen. Can you hear them? The cries?
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20129wr.at2   Commissioner! A rogue transmission is being broadcast on all wavelengths!
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20130ws.at2   At last.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20131ws.at2   The time has come to cleanse this world.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20132ws.at2   The pure will be "spared" for the cause,
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20133ws.at2   while the tainted will be hunted down and exterminated.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20134ws.at2   They shall be slashed, strangled, and slaughtered. Beaten, stabbed, and crushed. Garroted and impaled. Shot and executed without mercy.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20135ws.at2   The time has come to cleanse this world.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20136ws.at2   [laughs]

event/scene/ev0200/sound/20138rv.at2   What was that?

event/scene/ev0200/sound/20201vn.at2   Are you alright?
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20202rv.at2   I'll be fine. But that's more than I can say for the engine.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20203rv.at2   Vincent. If possible, I want you to continue on to Edge.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20204rv.at2   That transmission we just saw troubles me. Once I have repaired the Shadowfox, I'll need to return to headquarters.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20205rv.at2   A WRO squad has already been dispatched to Edge.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20206rv.at2   Join them and help liberate the city.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20207vn.at2   I guess I have no choice.
event/scene/ev0200/sound/20301rv.at2   Vincent! Use this!

event/scene/ev0300/sound/30203rs.at2   Nicely said, Weiss.
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30204rs.at2   I wonder if this will be a little more amusing than last time.

event/scene/ev0300/sound/30211vn.at2   A kid?

event/scene/ev0300/sound/30303vn.at2   Vincent Valentine. Reeve sent me.
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30304sa.at2   My apologies. Shalua Rui of the WRO.
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30305sa.at2   The commissioner has told me much about you.
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30306vn.at2   What happened here?
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30307sa.at2   That's what I'd like to know.
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30308sa.at2   I'm here on other business, but something's not right. It's too quiet.
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30309sa.at2   I've seen no trace of Deepground, or the squads that were sent in to fight them.
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30310sa.at2   Also, where are the 500 people who are supposed to still be living here?
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30311sa.at2   Well, this is getting us nowhere.
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30312sa.at2   Like I said, I have business to attend to. I'll see you around.
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30313vn.at2   Business?
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30314sa.at2   The commissioner keeps telling me I'm wasting my time searching.
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30315vn.at2   Searching for what?
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30316sa.at2   For my reason to live.

event/scene/ev0300/sound/30604vn.at2   Protomateria?
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30605rs.at2   Yes. The key to controlling Omega. We know you have it.
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30606rs.at2   Hand it over now, and I'll kill you quickly.
event/scene/ev0300/sound/30607rs.at2   Not one to bargain, are we?

event/scene/ev0400/sound/40201vn.at2   Talk! Why did you let this happen!?
event/scene/ev0400/sound/40202hj.at2   Silence.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/40203vn.at2   You!
event/scene/ev0400/sound/40204hj.at2   Silence!!!
event/scene/ev0400/sound/40205vn.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev0400/sound/40206hj.at2   Why can't these people just keep quiet?
event/scene/ev0400/sound/40207hj.at2   Ah yes. I can use this specimen's body for my next experiement. A genius. That's what I am yes! Success here will justify me- all my previous failures...
event/scene/ev0400/sound/40301vn.at2   [breathing, pained effort, struggle]
event/scene/ev0400/sound/50801vn.at2   That was my sin.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/50802vn.at2   And this... this is my punishment.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/50803vn.at2   [breathing, pained effort, yelling]
event/scene/ev0400/sound/80701lc.at2   Vincent. Just a little longer. Then I can let you out.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/80702lc.at2   What's wrong with me lately? Maybe I've been working too hard.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/80703hj.at2   I thought I heard a rat down here.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/80704hj.at2   And just what do you think you're doing with my failed experiment?
event/scene/ev0400/sound/80705lc.at2   Get out of my lab!
event/scene/ev0400/sound/80706hj.at2   Silence! I'm the one giving orders here!

event/scene/ev0400/sound/80710hj.at2   You're using this fine specimen to finish your thesis, aren't you, Doctor?
event/scene/ev0400/sound/80711lc.at2   No. You're wrong!
event/scene/ev0400/sound/80712hj.at2   Am I? Once a scientist, always a scientist, I must say.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/80713hj.at2   How happy this fellow must be. Helping his beloved even after he's begun rotting away.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/80714hj.at2   [Laughing]

event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0201vn.at2   Lucrecia? Hello?
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0202vn.at2   Anybody here?
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0203vn.at2   Father?
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0205lc.at2   Who's...!?
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0206vn.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0207lc.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0208vn.at2   Lucrecia. This file...
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0209lc.at2   It's none of your business.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0210vn.at2   But it is. Why didn't you tell me you worked with my father?
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0211lc.at2   Stop it! Just stop it!
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0212vn.at2   Lucrecia...
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0213lc.at2   I... It was all my fault. I didn't mean for your father to die. I couldn't... I'm so sorry.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0214vn.at2   But I never blamed her. All I wanted was to see her smiling face.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0215vn.at2   But after that day, the light left her heart.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0216hj.at2   So you've come to your senses and chosen me.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0217lc.at2   Yes, doctor.
event/scene/ev0400/sound/a0218vn.at2   However, if she is happy, then I don't mind.

event/scene/ev0410: WRO HEADQUARTERS - LAB
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40401sa.at2   Well, look who's awake.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40402sa.at2   Hold on. I'll release you.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40403vn.at2   Where am I?
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40404sa.at2   Safe inside the WRO headquarters. I carried you back here from Edge after you collapsed during your fight with Deepground.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40405sa.at2   It seems like the beast inside you went a little wild back there.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40406sa.at2   This happen often?
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40407vn.at2   Went wild? Do you mean Chaos?
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40408sa.at2   Chaos?
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40409sa.at2   Your body harbors the Chaos gene?
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40410sa.at2   So that explains your relationship with Dr. Lucrecia Crescent.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40411sa.at2   Were you the product of one of her experiments?
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40412vn.at2   Lucrecia's experiments?
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40413sa.at2   I apologize. That wasn't what I meant.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40414vn.at2   Wait. Lucrecia was researching Chaos?
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40415sa.at2   Don't tell me you didn't know.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40416sa.at2   Crescent. Shinra class A scientist specializing in biotechnology.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40417sa.at2   In her research thesis, "The Planet's Pulse,"
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40418sa.at2   she refers to Chaos as one of the sentient xenoforms residing among us.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40419sa.at2   However, the theories that she presented in her work were so abstract and complex... that no one in Shinra took her seriously. Still, I heard rumors that the brilliant Professor Ghast later showed some interest in her findings...
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40420sa.at2   Hm?
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40421lc.at2   I'm so sorry.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40422lc.at2   Awaken.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40423sa.at2   Are you alright?
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40424vn.at2   Can I see that thesis?
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40425sa.at2   Unfortunately, no.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40426sa.at2   On top of being obscure, it was never even submitted to the Shinra database.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40427sa.at2   All I know is what I saw while going through the company's archives.
event/scene/ev0410/sound/40428rv.at2   Vincent! Have you recovered already?

event/scene/ev0460: WRO HEADQUARTERS - LAB
event/scene/ev0460/sound/40601rv.at2   So Rosso the Crimson told you that Protomateria is the "key to controlling Omega"?
event/scene/ev0460/sound/40602vn.at2   Yeah.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/40603rv.at2   Any ideas?
event/scene/ev0460/sound/40605sa.at2   Soul wrought of terra corrupt, quelling impurity, purging the stream to beckon forth an ultimate fate. Behold mighty Chaos, Omega's squire to the lofty heavens.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/40606rv.at2   Where did you...?
event/scene/ev0460/sound/40607sa.at2   A passage from Dr. Crescent's thesis.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/40608sa.at2   But that's all I know. Unfortunately, I only saw a fragment of the document.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/40609sa.at2   However, Chaos... Omega... And...
event/scene/ev0460/sound/40610sa.at2   All seem to be connected to Dr. Crescent in some way. There's no other explanation.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/40612sa.at2   I think we'll need to gather more data on her to get anywhere.

event/scene/ev0460/sound/41203sa.at2   I knew it.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41205sa.at2   Shelke.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41206sk.at2   I have no acquaintances in the WRO.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41207sa.at2   We've both changed so much. No, you haven't changed at all.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41208sa.at2   Not in ten years.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41209sk.at2   [gasp]
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41210sa.at2   Shelke. It's me. Shalua. I've been searching for you for so long.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41211sk.at2   Don't take another step.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41212sa.at2   Shelke?
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41213sk.at2   It doesn't matter who I am or who you are. My current mission as a Deepground soldier is all that is relevant.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41214sa.at2   No! It does matter! Even though ten years have passed, you're still Shelke, my only sister!
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41215sk.at2   Ten years. Has it been that long?
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41216sk.at2   The day they came to take me away, I was told I had potential. But those words were nothing but a precursor to a decade of suffering.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41217sk.at2   They manipulated my mind until I was a shadow of my original self.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41218sk.at2   The pain. The fear. For ten years I lived in a hell far deeper
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41219sk.at2   than any you could imagine.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41220sk.at2   But look at me. I should be 19 this year.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41221sk.at2   If I don't receive my daily dose of mako, this body wouldn't last a day.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41223sk.at2   However, I don't consider myself the least bit unfortunate.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41224sk.at2   Except that for so long I held on to a foolish thread of hope that someday, someone would come to save me.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41225sa.at2   I'm sorry, Shelke. I'm so sorry.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41226sk.at2   It's time to put the past behind us.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41227rv.at2   Stop this!
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41228sk.at2   [effort, gasp]
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41229sk.at2   Reeve Tuesti.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41230rv.at2   So you are Shalua's younger sister.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41231sk.at2   Excellent. Now I can terminate both of you at once.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41232rv.at2   Look at her.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41233rv.at2   That's the price Shalua has paid fighting Shinra for the past ten years.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41234rv.at2   She has given more than her arm, more than her eye. She has put her life on the line time and time again.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41235rv.at2   All to find her lost sister.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41236rv.at2   More than half her organs have been reconstructed. Not a day goes by when Shalua doesn't suffer the pain of a hundred souls. But still, she...
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41237sk.at2   Enough.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41238sk.at2   I've... I've heard enough.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41239rv.at2   Stop!
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41240rv.at2   Vincent!
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41241rv.at2   Use these.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41242sa.at2   Shelke? Shelke!
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41243rv.at2   Don't worry. The bullets will only sedate her. Let Vincent handle this.

event/scene/ev0460/sound/41250rv.at2   Vincent! Over here!
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41251sa.at2   [crying]
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41252rv.at2   Vincent!
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41253rv.at2   JP
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41301rv.at2   JP
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41302vn.at2   You shouldn't leave those things lying around.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41303rv.at2   [laughing]
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41304az.at2   Ha!
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41305az.at2   [laughing]
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41306rv.at2   [gasp]
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41307az.at2   [laughing]
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41308az.at2   Well done. You have broken through my barrier.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41309vn.at2   This ends here. Leave him to me.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41310az.at2   Long has it been since I faced
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41311az.at2   a worthy opponent!

event/scene/ev0460/sound/41313vn.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41401az.at2   You may think this is the end, but...
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41501rv.at2   Where are you...
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41502vn.at2   Nibelheim.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41503rv.at2   Wait. Shinra Manor? But that is where...
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41504rv.at2   Understood.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41505rv.at2   However, be on your guard. We have reports of Deepground units deployed in that area.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41506rv.at2   If you wish to enter the manor in one piece, I suggest you use the sewer system extending from the old mako reactor.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41507vn.at2   Sewer? How appropriate is that?
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41508rv.at2   Now, as for me and my feline companion...
event/scene/ev0460/sound/41509rv.at2   It is time we found out what Deepground is truly up to.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/d0201rv.at2   Vincent!
event/scene/ev0460/sound/d0202rv.at2   The enemy has breached the main gate! Hurry!
event/scene/ev0460/sound/d0203rv.at2   Don't worry. I'll be fine here.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/d0204rv.at2   But Vincent... the Tsviets. Azul is still on the loose!
event/scene/ev0460/sound/d0205az.at2   Move.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/d0206az.at2   Painless.
event/scene/ev0460/sound/d0207az.at2   Go!

ev480: DEEPGROUND HIDEOUT
event/scene/ev0480/sound/40501az.at2   What is the status of our keeper?
event/scene/ev0480/sound/40502sk.at2   His location remains unchanged since the confrontation.
event/scene/ev0480/sound/40503sk.at2   We can assume this is the WRO headquarters.
event/scene/ev0480/sound/40504az.at2   Good. Two birds with one stone.
event/scene/ev0480/sound/b0483sk.at2   Who is she?
event/scene/ev0480/sound/b0484nr.at2   Dr. Lucrecia Crescent.
event/scene/ev0480/sound/b0485sk.at2   So I am to collect the data files-- the fragments she left within the network?
event/scene/ev0480/sound/b0486nr.at2   Correct. Then you are to use that data to find the Protomateria.
event/scene/ev0480/sound/b0487nr.at2   That is where he requires your assistance.
event/scene/ev0480/sound/b0488sk.at2   He...?
event/scene/ev0480/sound/b0489sk.at2   That information is unnecessary.
event/scene/ev0480/sound/b0490sk.at2   Connect with her, Vincent. Connect with her heart.

event/scene/ev0500: SHINRA MANOR
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50402vn.at2   Lucrecia!
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50403lc.at2   Vincent, right?
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50404lc.at2   Have you come to check up on me?
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50405lc.at2   Omega. His awakening is upon us.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50415lc.at2   I will leave a copy of my records here for you, Vincent.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50416lc.at2   Though I cannot imagine what help they might be, if any at all.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50417lc.at2   Just remember...
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50418lc.at2   I am so sorry.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50419vn.at2   Lucrecia.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50501vn.at2   [wince]
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50502vn.at2   This pain.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50503rs.at2   Well, well. We meet again.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50504rs.at2   This is perfect. I so wanted to see you, my love.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50505vn.at2   Deepground. What are they attempting to do with Omega?
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50506rs.at2   I don't know. And to be honest, I don't care.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50507vn.at2   What?
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50508rs.at2   But this is what Weiss desires.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50509rs.at2   Hail Weiss.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50510rs.at2   And what Weiss orders, we do. It is very simple.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50511rs.at2   If he desires the awakening of Omega, then that is what all of Deepground desires.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50512rs.at2   We could care less what happens to the planet.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50513rs.at2   But all this matters little to me.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50514rs.at2   It is not every day you are granted the chance to cleanse the world of all life.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50515rs.at2   Just the thought sends a chill of excitement through my body.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50516rs.at2   The Deepground soldiers were born and bred to kill. We were chained to a destiny of servitude.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50517rs.at2   But then three years ago, we were freed from our chains--though waiting for us was darkness lit only by the faint glow of mako.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50518rs.at2   And what do you think we did when we gained our freedom?
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50519rs.at2   We killed. That is how we were raised. That is all we knew.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50520rs.at2   And so I bathed in the blood of a thousand soldiers.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50521rs.at2   And I enjoyed it. I reveled in it.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50522rs.at2   And when I finally stepped out of the abyss, I craved for more.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50523rs.at2   You understand, right?
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50524vn.at2   I don't think so.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50525rs.at2   How can you say that, darling? We're one and the same.
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50601vn.at2   [pained effort, gasp, struggle]
event/scene/ev0500/sound/50602rs.at2   I'm sorry. Were you not expecting that?

event/scene/ev0500/sound/50609rs.at2   Well, there will be no need for it when I'm done with you.

event/scene/ev0520: CRESCENT CAVE
event/scene/ev0520/sound/50406lc.at2   Soul wrought of terra corrupt, quelling impurity, purging the stream to beckon forth an ultimate fate. Behold mighty Chaos, Omega's squire to the lofty heavens.
event/scene/ev0520/sound/50407lc.at2   I came across this passage while studying the scriptures of the Ancients.
event/scene/ev0520/sound/50408lc.at2   The Chronicles of Yore.
event/scene/ev0520/sound/50409lc.at2   Omega. The end. Just as all other sentient beings, he too, is born of the Lifestream.
event/scene/ev0520/sound/50410lc.at2   However, his only purpose is to cleanse the planet of all things living
event/scene/ev0520/sound/50411lc.at2   and lead their immortal souls through the abyssal aether to a new beginning far, far beyond the neverending sea of stars.
event/scene/ev0520/sound/50412lc.at2   Just as life circulates through our planet, so too, does our planet through the universe. Or at least in theory.
event/scene/ev0520/sound/50413lc.at2   However, what I can be certain of is, if Omega awakens, then all life as we know it will end.
event/scene/ev0520/sound/50414lc.at2   And when Omega has embarked on his journey to the cosmos, our planet will wither and die.

event/scene/ev0550/sound/50209lc.at2   Lucrecia Crescent.
event/scene/ev0550/sound/50210lc.at2   Pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Valentine.
event/scene/ev0550/sound/50701vn.at2   Is it true?
event/scene/ev0550/sound/50702hj.at2   Is what true?
event/scene/ev0550/sound/50703vn.at2   That Lucrecia... That Dr. Crescent is to take part in this project?
event/scene/ev0550/sound/50704lc.at2   It's true.
event/scene/ev0550/sound/50706lc.at2   Why are you so surprised?
event/scene/ev0550/sound/50707vn.at2   But using your own child for an experiment?
event/scene/ev0550/sound/50708hj.at2   I don't know what you're implying, but both of us are scientists. We know what we are doing.
event/scene/ev0550/sound/50709hj.at2   You are the last person to have any word in this. Now leave us at once, boy!
event/scene/ev0550/sound/50710vn.at2   But...

event/scene/ev0600/sound/60201yf.at2   Morning!
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60202vn.at2   Where...?
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60203vn.at2   Who are you?
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60204yf.at2   Well, I'm glad you asked!
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60205yf.at2   I am the champion of the earth and the sky. I am the conqueror of evil.
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60206yf.at2   The single white rose of Wutai.

event/scene/ev0600/sound/60209yf.at2   Ow!
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60210vn.at2   So, where are we?
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60211yf.at2   C'mon, aren't you at least a little concerned.
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60212vn.at2   Yuffie. It's been a while. How's your head?
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60213yf.at2   You... could you at least pretend to be sympathetic!?
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60214vn.at2   [wince]
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60215yf.at2   Hey, take it easy. That was a big hole you had in your chest.
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60216vn.at2   A hole in my chest?
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60218yf.at2   I seriously thought you were a goner, but then the wound healed itself right up. You were always "different," but I guess that's why you're still breathing.
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60220vn.at2   Yuffie, what are you doing here?
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60221yf.at2   Me? I'm just helping out Reeve and his gang.
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60222yf.at2   I was poking around Nibelheim and I found you looking all corpselike in Shinra Manor. So I saved you.
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60223yf.at2   Imagine that--me, saving the great Vincent Valentine. Do I get any thanks?
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60224vn.at2   Thanks, Yuffie.
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60225yf.at2   I didn't mean for you to take me so seriously.
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60226yf.at2   Anyway... Reeve wanted us to contact him as soon as you woke up.
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60235yf.at2   There you have it. I don't know what's going down, but it sounds big. I've been waiting a long time to get my hands on those Deepground punks.
event/scene/ev0600/sound/60236yf.at2   They've had their way long enough. Now it's time to give them a taste of Pain a la Yuffie.

event/scene/ev0630/sound/60229rv.at2   However, what I saw wasn't the prettiest of pictures.
event/scene/ev0630/sound/60230rv.at2   Omega... I should have known.
event/scene/ev0630/sound/60231rv.at2   We cannot let them sacrifice the lives of any more people. Once we've gathered our forces, we'll launch a full offensive.
event/scene/ev0630/sound/60232rv.at2   Of course, we'll require the help of you two as well. Please hurry back to headquarters.
event/scene/ev0630/sound/60233rv.at2   Oh. I'm analyzing the data files you sent earlier. I should have results soon.
event/scene/ev0630/sound/60234rv.at2   Tuesti out.

event/scene/ev0630/sound/60304sk.at2   [deep sigh]
event/scene/ev0630/sound/60305sk.at2   You were a fool to let your enemy live. Now I'm going to kill you and return to Deepground.
event/scene/ev0630/sound/60306sa.at2   I don't think so.
event/scene/ev0630/sound/60308sa.at2   I have to admit, I wasn't myself back there. Seeing you for the first time in ten years left me in a spin. But I've had time to recover.
event/scene/ev0630/sound/60309sa.at2   And I'm not letting you get away. Not this time.
event/scene/ev0630/sound/60310sa.at2   There's no way I'm going to let you kill me, and there's no way I'm going to let you go back to Deepground.
event/scene/ev0630/sound/60311sk.at2   I don't recall needing your permission to do anything.
event/scene/ev0630/sound/60312sa.at2   And I don't remember you ever being able to win any of our fights, do you? How about it? You want to try your luck?

event/scene/ev0650: WRO HEADQUARTERS - BASEMENT CORRIDOR
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60601g1.at2   [yelling]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60602vn.at2   What the hell?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60603sk.at2   Azul.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60604az.at2   [roar]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60605vn.at2   Shalua!
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60606sa.at2   [pained effort]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60607az.at2   [roar]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60608sk.at2   The extreme potency of this shield materia is comparable to that of your barrier field, Azul.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60609az.at2   Shelke? Why do you stand in my way?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60610sk.at2   [deep sigh]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60611sk.at2   I had to protect myself. You were trying to kill me.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60612az.at2   Then now is the time.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60613sk.at2   [surprise effort]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60614az.at2   You are no longer required.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60615sk.at2   No longer...?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60616az.at2   You are no different from the others. Your weak body is nothing without mako.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60617az.at2   Your only skill is collecting data from inside a virtual reality.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60618az.at2   It makes me sick to even think of you as a member of the Tsviets.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60619az.at2   Weiss has ordered your termination.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60620sk.at2   Weiss!?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60621az.at2   Your mission was to identify and locate the keeper of the Protomateria.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60622az.at2   That is why we uploaded the doctor's data into your neural network.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60623az.at2   But now we no longer need it.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60624az.at2   And we cannot let it fall into the hands of the WRO.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60625az.at2   Your fate has been decided, Shelke. It is time for you to return to the planet.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60626sa.at2   Vincent! Shelke! Let's get out of here!
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60628sa.at2   C'mon!
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60629sk.at2   Let go of me!
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60630sa.at2   I don't think so.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60631sk.at2   [surprise effort]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60632sa.at2   We have ten years to catch up on. I'm not going to let this end here--
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60634sa.at2   [pained effort]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60635sk.at2   Why are you doing this?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60636vn.at2   Shalua!
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60637sa.at2   You can still get through.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60638sk.at2   Huh?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60639sa.at2   Go on.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60640sa.at2   [pained effort]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60641sa.at2   Shelke.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60643sa.at2   I'm sorry... I'm sorry I wasn't a better sister.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60644sa.at2   I'm sorry I let you suffer so long.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60645sa.at2   Vincent. Take care of her, will you?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60646vn.at2   Wait!
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60647sa.at2   Shelke. I'm glad I was able to find you. And remember, I'll always love you.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60648vn.at2   [struggle effort]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60649sk.at2   Why?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60650sk.at2   [surprise effort]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60651sk.at2   Why did she...? Why?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60652sk.at2   Shalua...
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60653sa.at2   [pained effort]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60654sk.at2   [surprise gasp]

event/scene/ev0650/sound/60701rv.at2   [sigh]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60702rv.at2   I'm so ashamed.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60703rv.at2   I am supposed to be a hero of the Jenova War.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60704rv.at2   But look at me.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60705vn.at2   Don't take all the blame.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60706vn.at2   Reeve.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60707rv.at2   Huh?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60708vn.at2   You're not thinking of giving up, are you?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60709vn.at2   I used to be nothing but a stone in the river of time, but three years ago it was you and the others who taught me I had to move ahead.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60710rv.at2   Vincent...
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60801yf.at2   They say she won't wake up.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60802yf.at2   She suffered too much trauma to her head. Unless there's some kind of a miracle, she's not...
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60803yf.at2   Vincent! You were there! Why couldn't you save her!?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60804vn.at2   I'm sorry.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60805yf.at2   No.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60806yf.at2   I didn't mean to...
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60807sk.at2   She was a fool.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60808yf.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60809yf.at2   You have no right to call her that!
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60810yf.at2   You don't know... You don't know what...!
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60811sk.at2   Why... Why would she do something so...?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60812vn.at2   Before,
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60813vn.at2   when I asked Shalua what she was searching for, she answered "her reason to live."
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60814vn.at2   It was you, Shelke. You were her reason to live.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60815sk.at2   So?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60816sk.at2   I don't understand how someone could give her own life for that of another.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60817sk.at2   Do you understand, Vincent Valentine?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60818vn.at2   I can't answer for your sister.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60819vn.at2   But...
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60820sk.at2   But?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60821vn.at2   When a person has someone they care about that much, giving their life is sometimes the least they can do.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60822vn.at2   And maybe that's what makes us human.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60823sk.at2   Someone they care about...
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60824vn.at2   Although...
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60825vn.at2   it seems like there are alot of people around me who don't need a reason to risk their lives for that of another.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60826sk.at2   And are you...
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60827sk.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60828yf.at2   [crying]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/60829yf.at2   [crying]
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61002sk.at2   I'm sorry.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61003sk.at2   Why are her data fragments responding?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61004rv.at2   Vincent.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61005rv.at2   I agree with you. This is not the time for us to give up.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61006rv.at2   But I need to know something. Those data files you recovered from Shinra Manor-- are you sure there were not any more?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61007vn.at2   I'm sure.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61008rv.at2   I see.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61009vn.at2   What's wrong?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61010rv.at2   Well, the Omega Report... The file was incomplete.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61011rv.at2   To make any sense out of it, we are going to require the other half.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61012rv.at2   If possible, I wanted to know more about our foe before we launched the attack on Midgar.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61013sk.at2   Are you speaking of Dr. Lucrecia Crescent's findings?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61014rv.at2   Yes. But how did you...?
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61015sk.at2   A large quantity of her mnemonic data fragments has been uploaded into my neural network.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61016sk.at2   It was my prime directive to use this data to locate and retrieve the Protomateria.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61018sk.at2   However, not only was the data incomplete, but part of her consciousness began interfering with my own thought processes.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61019sk.at2   It was believed that the missing fragments may have been the reason for this.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61021sk.at2   I can attempt to upload the WRO's files on the Omega Report.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61022sk.at2   By combining it with the data I possess, you may obtain a clearer picture of what you will be up against.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61023sk.at2   And perhaps I can regain control of my mind.
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61024yf.at2   Vincent! Reeve! You'd better get out here!
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61101cd.at2   JP
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61102cd.at2   JP
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61103yf.at2   Cid!
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61104yf.at2   Hey!
event/scene/ev0650/sound/61105yf.at2   Over here!

event/scene/ev0700: THE SHERA
event/scene/ev0700/sound/70101cd.at2   Hey! Vincent! Long time.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/70102sm.at2   Captain!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/70103cd.at2   Sorry 'bout that.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/70104cd.at2   As much as I'd like to sit down and reminisce 'bout old times, you'll have to take a rain check. Why don't you have a look around my bird until the meeting?
event/scene/ev0700/sound/70105yf.at2   [Gags]
event/scene/ev0700/sound/70106yf.at2   Man, I hate airships.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/70107yf.at2   I knew I shouldn't have had eggs for breakfast!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/70108yf.at2   Sorry Vince. I don't feel like talking much.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/70109rv.at2   Thanks to Shelke's half of the data, I have been able to make more sense of the report.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/70110rv.at2   But I still require more time to piece together the fragments. I will give you all a detailed briefing at the meeting.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/70201cd.at2   Alright. Our old buddies and the remaining WRO squads will lead the ground assault...

event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0301za.at2   Sir!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0302zb.at2   Sir!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0401zc.at2   Beautiful, isn't it?
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0402zc.at2   I've been a crew member for almost three years now. You think after a few hundred flights, I'd get tired of the view.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0403zc.at2   But you know... when I realized that this may be my last time up here, my last chance to take a glimpse of the land I call home, I just...
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0404zc.at2   I... just wanted to get one last look.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0501zd.at2   Sir!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0502zd.at2   Did you notice the ceiling? It changes over time!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0503zd.at2   Aren't you amazed at all the things technology can do? It's like magic!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0504zd.at2   If only I could design something this remarkable...
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0601ze.at2   You've heard of the Chocobo farm in the grasslands, haven't you? They've got the biggest stables around.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0602ze.at2   I keep my new River Chocobo there. He was born just a few weeks ago. I named him Boko.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0603ze.at2   Boko! A noble name for a noble steed!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0604ze.at2   I can't wait until this battle is over and I can go ride him off into the sunset!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0701zf.at2   I took part in the Kalm operation. But... I... I wasn't able to save a single person.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0702zf.at2   That's why this time,
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0703zf.at2   maybe I'll be able to do something worthwhile!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0704zf.at2   I'm not going to let Deepground have its way anymore!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0801zg.at2   While this airship is named after Cid's wife, construction of the vessel wasn't performed by the captain at all.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0802zg.at2   Our team of loyal scientists here at the World Regenesis Organization, or those criminals at Shinra weren't involved either.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0803zg.at2   To tell you the truth, the ship is not even from this era. It is relic from a lost civilization.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0804zg.at2   Most of the machinery in the engine room is boxed up in black casing. So we don't even know what half of it does.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0805zg.at2   Oh, no... there's no need to worry! Even though we cannot reproduce the technology, we can still put it to good use.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0806zg.at2   I can almost guarantee there'll be no problems.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0807zg.at2   Almost.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0901zh.at2   That Dr. Rui...
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0902zh.at2   She dun gone sacrificed everything she had to find that there little sister of hers! But now she's...
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e0903zh.at2   I just don't wanna see nothing like that happen to nobody ever again! And that's why I packed up and joined the WRO!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1001zi.at2   Deepground Soldiers. A ruthless band of killing machines determined to revive Omega and bring this world to her end.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1002zi.at2   And at the top stand at Tsviets, a small group of elite warriors more powerful than the rest combined.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1003zi.at2   Rosso the Crimson, Azul the Cerulean, Nero the Sable...
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1004zi.at2   And their mysterious and enigmatic leader, Weiss the Immaculate.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1005zi.at2   It is believed that confrontations with these four will be unavoidable,
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1006zi.at2   but their defeat is necessary for our mission's success.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1007zi.at2   However, I'm not worried. I know that you and the others will not let us or the planet down.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1101zj.at2   It's not much longer until the Midgar offensive begins.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1102zj.at2   The last time I saw action was back during the liberation of Edge, where my entire squad was wiped out by that bloodthirsty Crimson soldier.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1103zj.at2   The only reason I survived was because I fled from the area when I saw my companions fall. But...
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1104zj.at2   Not this time!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1105zj.at2   I finally realized that there are some things in this world that are worth dying for.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1201zk.at2   Sir. I ain't no hero, sir.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1202zk.at2   I ain't got what it takes to save the world. Not like you did, sir.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1203zk.at2   But I'm ready to fight!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1204zk.at2   And I know that there's somebody out there who needs me to fight for them-- and their freedoms!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1205zk.at2   And that's why I don't mind taking second stage to the heroes of this story. Heroes like you!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1206zk.at2   I'll do all that I can, and I'll do my best! Sir!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1301zl.at2   Our enemy, the Deepground soldiers.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1302zl.at2   They were all once just like us. They all had families, friends, even feelings.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1303zl.at2   So why did it ever have to come to this?
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1304zl.at2   What compelled Shinra to commit such hideous deeds?
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1305zl.at2   Now these once normal people continue to kill because it is all they know.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1306zl.at2   Are they solely to blame for their actions?
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1307zl.at2   No. I'm not condoning what they do.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1308zl.at2   I will never forgive them for the terror they have instilled in the hearts of my brothers.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1309zl.at2   They're our sworn enemy, and that will never, ever change.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1310zl.at2   But I'm not fighting simply to end their lives. I'm doing it to end the chaos that they started.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1401zm.at2   Haha! Before we get to Midgar, I'll have this baby purring like a kitten!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1402zm.at2   I hope I'm not petting her the wrong way.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1501zn.at2   Mr. Valentine!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1502zn.at2   Our troops are conducting their final preparations for the assault. I've been ordered to not let anyone pass, sir!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1601zo.at2   Midgar...
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1602zo.at2   After meteor fall, the once bustling Metropolis was reduced to rubble. There have been attempts to rebuild, but deadly Mako radiation leaking from the damaged reactors still contaminates most of the area.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1603zo.at2   Now it's just a home for vagrants and the soldiers forgotten there after the calamity.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1604zo.at2   Most of us turned our eyes away from the problem. But someday we'll be forced to face it.

event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1801zq.at2   When I was still a kid, I wanted to be in Soldier.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1802zq.at2   But those men and women in Deepground,
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1803zq.at2   they're nothing like the guys in the poster I had on my bedroom wall.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1804zq.at2   But, you know, I wonder if they wanted to be in Soldier just like me.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1805zq.at2   Hey, I'm not going soft or anything! I'm ready for action!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1901zr.at2   Mr. Valentine, it's me!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1902zr.at2   Don't you remember? I was one of the Highwind crew!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1903zr.at2   That bird was a beauty! But this ship's just as sweet!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1904zr.at2   And you won't believe this, but she runs on some mysterious ancient power.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1905zr.at2   But you don't have to worry. You'll be safe in my hands.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1906zr.at2   Wait a minute. Where did this button come from?
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1907zr.at2   Oh, no. You didn't hear anything!
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e1908zr.at2   Ahem. Approaching destination!

event/scene/ev0700/sound/e2101zt.at2   You know that little girl? She's locked herself up in the sick bay since we boarded.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e2201zu.at2   Sir! I've been spending time analyzing the data retrieved from the files of former Weapons Development Administrator Scarlet.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e2202zu.at2   Deepground.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e2203zu.at2   It used to be a medical facility for injured Soldier troops.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e2204zu.at2   Military personnel would be sent there for care and rehabilitation.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e2205zu.at2   However, over time, it evolved into a laboratory for madmen content on ignoring all laws of man and nature.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e2206zu.at2   And supposedly, this evolution took place because the existence of one rogue Soldier.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e2207zu.at2   A man known only as G.
event/scene/ev0700/sound/e2208zu.at2   However that was all we were able to retrieve.

event/scene/ev0730/sound/70208cd.at2   So Reeve, you ready?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70209rv.at2   Yes.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70220lc.at2   Omega is...
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70221sk.at2   the same type of life form as the Weapons we encountered three years ago.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70222sk.at2   The planet gave birth to these creatures to protect itself
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70223sk.at2   just as the planet will ultimately give birth to the final Weapon, Omega, when the end of the world is imminent.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70224sk.at2   In essence, Omega is an elaborate safety mechanism designed solely to maintain and protect the flow of life.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70225sk.at2   Normally, Omega poses no threat to us. It only manifests when the planet has detected something that may cause her danger.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70226rv.at2   However, Deepground is attempting to awaken the beast early.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70227rv.at2   Thus the kidnappings.

event/scene/ev0730/sound/70229c2.at2   Good gracious me!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70233rv.at2   By slaughtering thousands of innocent souls, they are creating a pure Lifestream in order to trick the planet into thinking the "end" is near.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70234cd.at2   Why, those conniving...!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70235cd.at2   I don't know what this Weiss character is tryin', but he's crazy if he thinks we're gonna let him get away with it.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70236rv.at2   Right.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70237rv.at2   Omega is being revived deep beneath Midgar in Mako Reactor 0.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70238rv.at2   To increase the output of Reactor 0, all the other reactors have been tied into its mainframe.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70239rv.at2   Our objective is to destroy 1 through 8 and slow the reanimation process.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70240rv.at2   Mission details for each squad will be relayed separately.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70241cd.at2   Alright. We've still got some time before the big show.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70242cd.at2   You got anything needs tending to, do it.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70311cd.at2   Vince, don't worry about the reactors. We'll take care of them.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70312cd.at2   You work on those four wackos!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70313cd.at2   I don't like letting you have all the fun,
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70314cd.at2   but you know I can't leave my baby here alone.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70315cd.at2   Cloud and the others will be shutting down the power,
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70316cd.at2   and there's no way we're lettin' Yuffie go down there by herself.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70317cd.at2   Sorry buddy. Looks like from here on out it's Vince versus the Tsviets.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70318cd.at2   We're counting on you, old pal.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70319cd.at2   Yeah, but just look at Cait... I mean, Reeve. When the hell did he become so important?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70320cd.at2   All this you see around you--everything here--he put up the gil for it.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70321cd.at2   'Course that's on the condition that I help him save the world.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70322cd.at2   What I want to know is where he got that kind of cash.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70323cd.at2   When all this is over, how about we grab a couple of cold ones. Just like the good ol' days, huh?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70324cd.at2   Even Shera's been worried about you, and you know how she gets.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70325cd.at2   Countin' on ya.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70326yf.at2   [nausea]
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70327yf.at2   Did you hear? They attacked Wutai as well.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70328yf.at2   Thanks to my dad and the Wusheng, things didn't turn out as bad as they could have, but...
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70329yf.at2   But I'm worried about my old man. He's not as young as he used to be.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70330yf.at2   He's gonna have a heart attack one of these days, if not give me one!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70331yf.at2   Now, if I was there, dad wouldn't even have to put down his mai tai.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70332yf.at2   What? What?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70333yf.at2   I could take out Deepground with one hand tied behind my back!

event/scene/ev0730/sound/70335yf.at2   [nausea]
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70336vn.at2   So, no costume today?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70337rv.at2   Headquarters was pretty much destroyed by the deepground forces.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70338rv.at2   But I was able to salvage a few things.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70339ct.at2   Number 5 is alive!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70340ct.at2   Number 6, ready for action!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70341ct.at2   Number 7, nice to meet you!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70342vn.at2   Tell me Reeve...
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70343ct.at2   Huh?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70344vn.at2   Who's backing your operation?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70345ct.at2   Oh! That!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70346rv.at2   Actually, I'm not sure.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70348rv.at2   I've only met with... a representative.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70349rv.at2   However, the WRO is crucial for this planet's survival.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70350rv.at2   I'm not concerned with the reasons this person has for helping us. As long as he continues writing the checks.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70351rv.at2   Though I have a feeling it is probably someone who believes he is in debt to the planet.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70352ct.at2   Vincent, you should probably think of getting some rest.

event/scene/ev0730/sound/70366v3.at2   No way! We'll be okay! We always are, right?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70367v2.at2   Did you ever find B Block?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70368v3.at2   I don't know... I think so. I can't make heads or tails of this place.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70401cd.at2   Okay dogs, it's time!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70402cd.at2   All hands to battle stations!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70601cd.at2   Listen up! 'Cuz I'm only gonna say this once!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70602cd.at2   If any more of you are killed by those punks, I'll drag you back from hell and kill you again!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70603cd.at2   You really wanna piss of those SOBs, then why not try stayin' alive?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70604cd.at2   That's what this war's all about!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70605cd.at2   If you live, everybody behind you lives! If you die, they die!

event/scene/ev0730/sound/70607wl.at2   [Cheers "YEAH!"]
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70608yf.at2   Yeah!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70701sk.at2   Vincent Valentine.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70702vn.at2   What's this?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70703sk.at2   Your phone. I retrieved it in Kalm.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70704sk.at2   I've modified it slightly. Just dial #VIN to contact my personal terminal directly.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70705sk.at2   From this workstation, I can perform a synaptic net dive into almost any network system in Midgar. I may also be able to help guide you into Deepground.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70706sk.at2   It's not what you think.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70707sk.at2   By monitoring your movement, Dr. Crescent's data fragments are restored within me.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70708sk.at2   I'm simply providing this service for my own benefit.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70709vn.at2   I didn't say anything.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70710sk.at2   I... Anyway... my resources here are limited. Do not expect too much.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70711vn.at2   I'm counting on you, Shelke.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70712sk.at2   [stammer]
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70714sk.at2   I... It's just I've never actually been "counted on" by anyone before.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70715sk.at2   Never mind.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70716rv.at2   Well then, can I "count on" you to keep an eye on the airship while we're away as well?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70717sk.at2   Huh?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70718rv.at2   I have already witnessed your strength and skill once.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70719rv.at2   This is war, and we have to be ready for anything. Your assistance would be of great help.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70720sk.at2   My assistance?
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70721rv.at2   Exactly.
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70722wr.at2   Commissioner!
event/scene/ev0730/sound/70723rv.at2   Excuse me. Vincent, I will see you again before deployment.

event/scene/ev0750/sound/70902sk.at2   You have landed several klicks off your target destination.
event/scene/ev0750/sound/70903sk.at2   However, considering the location of the enemy, this could work to your advantage.
event/scene/ev0750/sound/70904sk.at2   Head for the central complex and locate a means of reaching the top level.
event/scene/ev0750/sound/70905sk.at2   You will only be able to enter Deepground from the upper platform.
event/scene/ev0750/sound/70906sk.at2   I'll contact you again. Shelke out.

event/scene/ev0750/sound/71205vn.at2   Yes it does.
event/scene/ev0750/sound/71206ww.at2   Sir, I've received a radio transmission reporting the remaining air squads have reached the upper level plates and joined the ground forces.
event/scene/ev0750/sound/71207vn.at2   Fine.
event/scene/ev0750/sound/71208ww.at2   Sir...

event/scene/ev0750/sound/71216ww.at2   You know, I was born in Midgar.
event/scene/ev0750/sound/71217ww.at2   My brother and I used to play here all the time. My mom didn't approve, though.

event/scene/ev0750/sound/71226cp.at2   To reach the central complex, you must proceed through this maze of decommissioned train cars.
event/scene/ev0750/sound/71227cp.at2   However, I have received reports that beyond the graveyard are some of the enemy's most powerful defenses.
event/scene/ev0750/sound/71228vn.at2   Alright. I'll see what I can do.
event/scene/ev0750/sound/71229cp.at2   Wait! I can't let you go without backup!

event/scene/ev0760/sound/71007rs.at2   I traded away my human weaknesses for power long ago.
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71008rs.at2   It is the path I've chosen.
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71009rs.at2   And the path I'll tread.
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71010rs.at2   Until I've sucked all life from this pitiful world!
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71011rs.at2   And I'm not going to let you get in the way.
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71012rs.at2   You've lived long enough, Vincent Valentine. And I'll make sure you don't come back this time...
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71013rs.at2   by slicing you into pieces!
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71101rs.at2   Do you know why they call me "the Crimson," darling?
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71102rs.at2   Let me show you!
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71103rs.at2   Someone stronger... than... than...
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71104rs.at2   Absurd...
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71105rs.at2   [struggle effort]
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71106rs.at2   Absurd!
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71107rs.at2   [breathy effort]
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71108rs.at2   Our time here together is done.
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71109rs.at2   But the mighty Azul awaits.
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71110rs.at2   I shall not grant you the pleasure of killing Rosso the Crimson.
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71111rs.at2   No one will ever stand above me!
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71112rs.at2   No one! No one! No one!
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71113rs.at2   [laughing]
event/scene/ev0760/sound/71114rs.at2   [pained effort]

event/scene/ev0770/sound/70111sk.at2   After the assault begins, the headquarter's facilities will no longer be available.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70112sk.at2   And to think just a few days ago, I was the one who was in there.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70113sk.at2   No, forget I said anything.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70114vn.at2   What are you working on?
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70115sk.at2   I'm in the process of modifying this equipment so I can perform an SND: a synaptic net dive.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70116vn.at2   Synaptic Net Dive?
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70117sk.at2   My specialty within the Tsviets.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70118sk.at2   While retaining consciousness, I project an image of myself into a virtual reality called a network.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70119sk.at2   I can also use this ability to negotiate with data on the subconscious planes of sentient life forms. However, this often involves a great risk to my own sanity.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70120sk.at2   For Shinra the success of the SND project was crucial for their next step in...
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70121sk.at2   I'm sorry, I seem to have gotten off track.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70122sk.at2   Simply put, I'm creating a personal network terminal within the airships main control console.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70123vn.at2   [grunt]
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70124sk.at2   What?
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70125vn.at2   Nothing. You just remind me of your sister.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70127sk.at2   If you don't mind I need to complete these modifications before the meeting.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70210ct.at2   Alright! Take it away, Shelke!
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70211sk.at2   Very well.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70212sk.at2   Data fragment link... successful. Commencing synaptic net dive in 3, 2, 1 ...
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70301sk.at2   So tired...
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70302sk.at2   Vincent Valentine.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70303vn.at2   What?
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70304sk.at2   This feeling. Is this what you meant by doing something for someone you care about?
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70305vn.at2   It seems so.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70306sk.at2   Dr. Crescent's data has begun defragmenting within my mind.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70307sk.at2   I can see many different images.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70308sk.at2   Images she experienced with you.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70309sk.at2   Interference... Recovery...
event/scene/ev0770/sound/70310sk.at2   So... So tired...
event/scene/ev0770/sound/80102sk.at2   The ground squads have not been able to penetrate the Deepground defenses. The mako reactors are still operating at full capacity.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/80122sk.at2   You really don't know, do you?
event/scene/ev0770/sound/80123sk.at2   The Protomateria helped you control Chaos. Now that you've lost it your mental state has become extremely unstable.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/80126lc.at2   Chaos. While a part of you, the entity exists independently from the rest of your body.
event/scene/ev0770/sound/80201sk.at2   You must fight him. I don't want you to die...

event/scene/ev0780/sound/70501az.at2   A simultaneous attack from land and air. I think they may be serious this time.
event/scene/ev0780/sound/70502rs.at2   They had better be. I've been so bored lately.
event/scene/ev0780/sound/70503nr.at2   His awakening is near.
event/scene/ev0780/sound/70504nr.at2   Let tonight be the final chapter.

event/scene/ev0800/sound/80103vn.at2   So it seems.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80104sk.at2   What is your location?
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80105vn.at2   Shinra building...
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80106vn.at2   or what remains of it.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80107sk.at2   The same as it was three years ago.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80108sk.at2   Though, after Meteorfall, there wasn't much left of Midgar at all.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80109sk.at2   With the exception of Deepground.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80111sk.at2   The passage to Deepground should be located within Shinra building.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80112sk.at2   Search for the president's personal entrance.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80113vn.at2   Alright.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80114vn.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80115kh.at2   [chaos]
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80116sk.at2   Is something wrong?

event/scene/ev0800/sound/80118lc.at2   Vincent!
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80119sk.at2   Vincent!
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80120vn.at2   What's going on?
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80121vn.at2   Why is Chaos...? Why now?
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80124vn.at2   Protmateria? Control Chaos?
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80125sk.at2   Yes. If you recall, you had it extracted from your chest by Rosso.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80127vn.at2   Shelke?
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80128sk.at2   Chaos. The harbinger of anarchy.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80129vn.at2   Lucrecia.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80130lc.at2   Born before the planet dies, he shall gather together all life for Omega's journey to the sea of stars.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80131lc.at2   That is Chaos. And he slumbers inside you.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80132sk.at2   Born before the planet dies, he shall gather together all life for Omega's journey to the sea of stars.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80133sk.at2   That is Chaos. And he slumbers inside you.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80135lc.at2   I'm so sorry.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80136lc.at2   You must fight him. I don't want you to die...
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80137sk.at2   I'm so sorry.

event/scene/ev0800/sound/80329wl.at2   Hey, I got through! Tifa? Wha? You got through!? Yo! Vincent! You still alive!? Of course he is, we're talking to him, aren't we? And do you really have to shout right next to my ear? Sorry 'bout that, Tifa! I apologize, Vincent. Here's Cloud. Vincent? Cloud. It's been a while.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80330wl.at2   Cid's airship? We lost contact about 15 minutes ago. I don't think we have to worry, though. Those two should be fine. Yeah. And what about you?
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80331wl.at2   What do you think? Right! You can count on us! When I'm through, there won't be a single sucka standing!
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80332wl.at2   Right. And as for you... Don't worry. Leave Deepground to me. Can you hold on a second?
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80333wl.at2   Tifa. Got it! Vincent, I'm sending you a map of the Shinra Building.
event/scene/ev0800/sound/80334wl.at2   Deepground is below the complex. Take an elevator as far down as you can. Good lu-- Give 'em hell, Vincent! Barret, I thought I told you to-- Don't go getting yourself killed, now.

event/scene/ev0820/sound/80203cd.at2   Hey! Engine room! What the hell's going on down there!?
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80204cd.at2   Engine room! Dammit!
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80205sk.at2   What is wrong?
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80206cd.at2   Don't have a damn clue. All of a sudden, engine levels began dropping like crazy.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80207cd.at2   We haven't taken any direct hits, so everything should be running like clockwork.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80208sk.at2   I will go have a look.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80209cd.at2   Thanks. Counting on you.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80211sk.at2   It can't be.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80212nr.at2   Fancy meeting you here, Shelke.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80214sk.at2   You.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80215nr.at2   Quite unexpected.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80216sk.at2   Why did you come here, Nero?
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80217nr.at2   Why? I was short a few souls, and came to collect.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80218sk.at2   What did you do with the crew?
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80219nr.at2   Need you ask? Look around. My mission is complete.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80220sk.at2   Oh...
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80221sk.at2   [sigh, gasp]
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80222nr.at2   And what do we think we are doing?
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80223sk.at2   I don't really know.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80224sk.at2   However, since coming here I have realized one thing-- I don't want to let down anyone who's counting on me.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80225nr.at2   Pure nonsense.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80226sk.at2   Nonsense? Perhaps.
event/scene/ev0820/sound/80227nr.at2   [laughs]

event/scene/ev0850/sound/80401az.at2   So Rosso didn't survive.
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80402az.at2   Oh... Something inside you wants out.
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80403az.at2   Its stench is so very familiar.
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80404az.at2   [laugh]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80405az.at2   Come, Vincent! Show me your rage!
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80406az.at2   Now, let the killing begin!
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80502az.at2   [laugh]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80503az.at2   This is how a battle should be.
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80504az.at2   Don't you think so?
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80505vn.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80506az.at2   Now feel my true strength. Feel the wrath of Azul the Cerulean!
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80507az.at2   [roar]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80601az.at2   [roar]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80602vn.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80603az.at2   Stand! Stand! This isn't over yet.
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80604az.at2   Good. Now come and fight.
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80605az.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80606az.at2   Why you!
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80607az.at2   [breathing]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80608az.at2   Chaos?
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80609az.at2   [pained effort]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80610az.at2   [pained effort]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80611az.at2   It looks like you were more a beast than I.
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80612az.at2   Very well. I'll see you again, Vincent... in hell!
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80613kh.at2   [Chaos]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80614az.at2   Hail Weiss!
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80615az.at2   [Laugh]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80616kh.at2   [Chaos]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80617nr.at2   So that is Chaos. Intriguing.
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80618nr.at2   "Soul wrought of terra corrupt."
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80619nr.at2   Perhaps I should simply let him live out his destiny of destruction.
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80620lc.at2   I'm so sorry.
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80621vn.at2   Huh?
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80622az.at2   [Pained effort]
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80801vn.at2   Chaos. Lucrecia used me to... Lucrecia...
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80802vn.at2   So this pain is...
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80803vn.at2   Shelke?
event/scene/ev0850/sound/80804vn.at2   Deepground. Shinra's dark secret.

event/scene/ev0900/sound/90101dg.at2   Hail Weiss!

event/scene/ev0910/sound/90201vn.at2   Huh?
event/scene/ev0910/sound/90202vn.at2   [Pained effort, struggle]
event/scene/ev0910/sound/90203kh.at2   [Chaos]
event/scene/ev0910/sound/90204sk.at2   No. Don't let Chaos control you.
event/scene/ev0910/sound/90205sk.at2   You cannot be contained by his darkness because a part of you was born from it.
event/scene/ev0910/sound/90206sk.at2   Find yourself. Regain control.
event/scene/ev0910/sound/90207vn.at2   JP

event/scene/ev0920/sound/90801nr.at2   A pleasure to finally meet you, Vincent.
event/scene/ev0920/sound/90802vn.at2   Nero.
event/scene/ev0920/sound/90803nr.at2   At first, I thought you nothing more than a nuisance. However, it seems I can no longer let you run about unchained. I must protect my beloved brother.
event/scene/ev0920/sound/90804vn.at2   Your brother?
event/scene/ev0920/sound/90805nr.at2   Dear Weiss. Powerful Weiss. The only person who ever loved me. And the only person I will ever love.
event/scene/ev0920/sound/90806nr.at2   However...
event/scene/ev0920/sound/90807nr.at2   But that is all forgotten. In a matter of moments, everything will change.
event/scene/ev0920/sound/90808vn.at2   What did you do with Shelke?
event/scene/ev0920/sound/90809nr.at2   Shelke?
event/scene/ev0920/sound/90810nr.at2   Ah yes, what did I do with her? I do recall running into the lass when I journeyed to the airship. A feisty one, she is.
event/scene/ev0920/sound/90811nr.at2   The girl is inside me, lost like a little puppy.
event/scene/ev0920/sound/90812nr.at2   So you wish to dance?
event/scene/ev0920/sound/90901nr.at2   Impressive. Perhaps Azul and Rosso never stood a chance against the mighty Valentine.
event/scene/ev0920/sound/90902nr.at2   But enough. I have other matters to attend to.
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91201nr.at2   I see. Soul wrought of terra corrupt. My darkness would have no control over you, would it? So I must try a different dance.
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91202nr.at2   How about...
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91203yf.at2   Even in a world where fear and despair reign over the heavens,
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91204yf.at2   you must never forget--where there is shadow, there is always light!
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91205yf.at2   That's right! Bask in my rays, evildoers!
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91206yf.at2   Feel the radiance of Wutai Super Ninja, Yuffie Kisaragi! Back and ready for action!
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91207nr.at2   My brother calls.
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91208vn.at2   Are you alright?
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91209sk.at2   I...
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91210sk.at2   I don't know. Maybe... Maybe I was dreaming.
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91211yf.at2   Hey!
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91212yf.at2   Over here, guys!
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91213yf.at2   [panicking, falling]
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91214yf.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev0920/sound/91215vn.at2   [sigh]
event/scene/ev0920/sound/a0942hj.at2   However, after completing this, I realized I still required a durable body. And that's when I remembered Deepground--home to the most powerful beings on this planet.

event/scene/ev0950/sound/90301sk.at2   As old as he is, and still acting like a helpless child..at2   I can see why Lucrecia had such a difficult time.
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90302sk.at2   I don't know why I'm doing this..at2   I will die when my magic runs out, anyway.
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90303lc.at2   Is this...?
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90304sk.at2   [gasp]
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90420lc.at2   Dr. Valentine!
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90421gm.at2   Tell my son that I'm sorry.
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90422lc.at2   Dr. Valentine! Dr. Valentine!
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90423gm.at2   My time has come to return to the Lifestream.
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90424lc.at2   No!
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90425lc.at2   No! Come back! Why did you have to fade away!? Why did you...
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90426lc.at2   [crying]
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90427sk.at2   It's alright. He simply returned to the planet.
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90601sk.at2   Shalua...
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90602sa.at2   Shelke.
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90603sa.at2   Is it alright for me to return to the planet?
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90604sk.at2   [gasp]
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90605sk.at2   No...
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90606sa.at2   Hm?
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90607sk.at2   Not yet. There's still so much I...
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90608sa.at2   Don't worry. We'll see each other again.
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90609sk.at2   A dream? No... Data... Data interference.
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90610sk.at2   [gasp]
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90611sk.at2   [gasp]
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90612sk.at2   I didn't think I had any tears left.
event/scene/ev0950/sound/90613sk.at2   [gasp]
event/scene/ev0950/sound/91101sk.at2   So this is the end.
event/scene/ev0950/sound/91102sk.at2   [gasp]
event/scene/ev0950/sound/91103vn.at2   I think you dropped this.
event/scene/ev0950/sound/91104vn.at2   Unless you find something appealing about this place, I suggest we leave.
event/scene/ev0950/sound/91105vn.at2   Let's go.
event/scene/ev0950/sound/91106sk.at2   [Sigh. Affirmation]
event/scene/ev0950/sound/91107sk.at2   [effort]

event/scene/ev0990/sound/50311ct.at2   [yelling, screaming, efforts]
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0101vn.at2   Will you be alright?
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0102sk.at2   Yes.
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0103sk.at2   Thank you.
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0104yf.at2   Okay!
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0105yf.at2   Now, let me see if I've got this. You keep going, find Nero and Weiss, and smack 'em into next Tuesday.
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0106yf.at2   And while you're cleaning house, I sneak into the reactor and shut her down.
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0107yf.at2   Sounds like a plan!
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0108yf.at2   So, see ya around, Vince!
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0109sk.at2   Vincent Valentine.
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0301sk.at2   Another dream?
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0302sk.at2   Vincent Valentine.
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0303vn.at2   Hm?
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0304sk.at2   Why are you fighting this battle?
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0305vn.at2   To destroy Deepground and stop Omega's return.
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0306vn.at2   It's time that an end is put to this madness. Or at least, that is what I tell myself.
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0307vn.at2   Though I'm not completely sure that's the reason.
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0308sk.at2   Not sure. Neither am I.
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0309sk.at2   But, Vincent...
event/scene/ev0990/sound/a0311sk.at2   I don't want to see the world end. I just don't want there to be any more pain.

event/scene/ev1000/sound/a0501vn.at2   Yuffie.
event/scene/ev1000/sound/a0502yf.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev1000/sound/a0503yf.at2   You don't look too roughed up.
event/scene/ev1000/sound/a0504vn.at2   Neither do you.
event/scene/ev1000/sound/a0505yf.at2   In there, huh?
event/scene/ev1000/sound/a0506vn.at2   Yeah. Come on.
event/scene/ev1000/sound/a0507yf.at2   [effort]

event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0601vn.at2   [gasp]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0602yf.at2   [gasp]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0603vn.at2   This is Weiss?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0604yf.at2   It's--he's--it's dead?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0605nr.at2   But not for long.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0606yf.at2   Not for long?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0607nr.at2   A new life breathes inside him. Just as one does in you, Valentine.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0609yf.at2   Huh?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0610vn.at2   Huh...
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0611vn.at2   That's what you're doing.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0612yf.at2   What's he doing? What's he doing? What's going on? I don't get it.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0613nr.at2   Soon, my dear brother will awaken.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0614nr.at2   It seems like an eternity since I was granted the knowledge of rebirth.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0615vn.at2   Granted?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0616yf.at2   By who?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0617ws.at2   [scream, roar]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0618vn.at2   What!?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0619yf.at2   Omega!?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0620nr.at2   Stay away from my brother!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0621yf.at2   [effort, gasp]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0622yf.at2   No! No!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0623vn.at2   You alright?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0624yf.at2   What the heck was that?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0625nr.at2   Oblivion perhaps. My darkness-- it can absorb as well as extract almost anything.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0626nr.at2   However, some things remain--
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0627nr.at2   things as black as the heart of a daemon.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0628nr.at2   The essence of death. Its ululations are like a lullaby.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0629yf.at2   How can you...
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0630vn.at2   Yuffie, stay here.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0631nr.at2   Ah yes, you were invulnerable to the darkness.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0632nr.at2   No one will take my brother away from me again.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0636nr.at2   [chuckle]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0637vn.at2   [gasp]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0638yf.at2   [gasp]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0639yf.at2   [gasp]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0640yf.at2   [yelling]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0641yf.at2   [gasp, breath]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0650wl.at2   [inhuman murmers]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0651wl.at2   [inhuman murmers]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0652wl.at2   [inhuman murmers, scream]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0653wl.at2   [inhuman murmers, scream]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0701nr.at2   Weiss.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0702nr.at2   [yell]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0801yf.at2   Sorry about that...
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0901nr.at2   Weiss.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0902nr.at2   My beloved brother. It is time.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0903ws.at2   [laugh]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0904nr.at2   Together at last. I won't leave you again. Never... Weiss...
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0905nr.at2   [pained effort]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0906nr.at2   Weiss?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0907ws.at2   I'm finished with you.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0908ws.at2   [laugh]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0909ws.at2   Your weapons are useless. My body is one with Omega. Just as yours is with Chaos.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0910ws.at2   The difference being, Chaos is nothing more than a pawn
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0911ws.at2   whereas Omega is the ultimate Weapon that will lead this planet's soul to the stars.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0912ws.at2   There is nothing that can destroy me. Nothing.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0913ws.at2   Vincent Valentine. And so we meet again.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0914vn.at2   What?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0915ws.at2   Still in the dark?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0917ws.at2   Three years ago, while I was still running about looking for Sephiroth, I took it upon myself to distribute my data-- my mind, my knowledge, my inner being, across the worldwide network.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0918ws.at2   And even though my body had died, and the world had been left in ruin, I survived in a virtual reality. When the network was restored, the scattered data regrouped and I was reborn.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0919ws.at2   A neo-Reunion, you could say.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0920vn.at2   You... You..!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0921ws.at2   That's right, boy. It's me.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0922ws.at2   JP
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0923ws.at2   Hello, Vincent. How long has it been? Three years?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0924hj.at2   That's right, boy. It's me.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0925hj.at2   JP
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0926hj.at2   Hello, Vincent. How long has it been? Three years?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0927hj.at2   You know, when I first read it, I thought that woman's thesis was utter nonsense.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0928hj.at2   I couldn't believe some fabled beast from legend past had anything to do with your survival.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0929hj.at2   However, three years ago when you transformed into Chaos right before my eyes, I must say I was shocked.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0930hj.at2   Who would have thought her theory was actually valid?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0931hj.at2   And so I began thinking. If Chaos exists, then so too must Omega.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0932hj.at2   And if you could become one, then maybe I could become the other to traverse the cosmos in a blaze of glory!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0933hj.at2   It was the chance of a lifetime.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0934hj.at2   But there was a problem. Only a strong shell could hold back Omega's might.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0935hj.at2   And it could not be just anyone.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0936hj.at2   You see boy, the reason you were able to play such a perfect host for Chaos was because my experiments had endowed you with a nearly indestructible body.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0937hj.at2   Thanks to me, you are standing here today.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0938hj.at2   Now, where was I?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0939hj.at2   Ah yes! I attempted to perfect my body for Omega by injecting myself with Jenova's cells. However, that didn't go as I had planned.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0940hj.at2   I failed to consider the fact that the cells might try to take over my mind and eat away at my soul.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0941hj.at2   And so, as a safety measure, I came up with a brilliant plan to transmit my neurodata across the worldwide network.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0943hj.at2   I even found a willing assistant in the lad Nero here to help carry out my so-called rebirth.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0944hj.at2   Though never did he expect I would take control of his "beloved" brother's mind.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0945hj.at2   [laugh]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0946hj.at2   And thus, with a new body, I began my final experiment.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0947hj.at2   If the Chaos within you was born of a tainted Lifestream,
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0948hj.at2   then the almighty Omega would be born of a pure one.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0951hj.at2   Only a scientist of my caliber is worthy to become one with Omega and leave this planet for the stars!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0952vn.at2   Hojo, I've heard enough.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0953hj.at2   Huh?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0954ws.at2   [scoff]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0955vn.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0956hj.at2   You're getting old, Vincent Valentine.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0957ws.at2   [laugh]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0958hj.at2   [laugh]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0959hj.at2   You just can't leave me alone, can you? Now, sit right there. I want you to see this.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0960ws.at2   And once I have absorbed the Lifestream...
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0961vn.at2   Wait!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0962hj.at2   Ah?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0963nr.at2   [pained effort]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0963vn.at2   This isn't over.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0964hj.at2   So eager to die, are we?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0964ws.at2   [laugh]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0965hj.at2   Very well. I wanted to test out this body before I began my journey, anyway.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0966ws.at2   [grunt]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0967ws.at2   Hojo!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a0968ws.at2   I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let us do this right.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1201ws.at2   That wasn't much of a test.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1202vn.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1203vn.at2   [roar]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1204ws.at2   Chaos.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1205ws.at2   [chuckle]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1206ws.at2   You already tried that, Vincent.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1207ws.at2   [chuckle]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1401ws.at2   Huh?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1402hj.at2   Huh?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1403lc.at2   Vincent. You cannot defeat this enemy by simply trying to overpower him.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1404lc.at2   Take control. Don't let Chaos rule you. You must rule Chaos. You can do it!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1405sk.at2   Vincent. You cannot defeat this enemy by simply trying to overpower him.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1406sk.at2   Take control. Don't let Chaos rule you. You must rule Chaos. You can do it!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1407ws.at2   Ha! Enough of this charade!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1408hj.at2   Ha! Enough of this charade!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1409lc.at2   Please, Vincent.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1410sk.at2   Please, Vincent.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1411hj.at2   Aha. It looks like our Dr. Crescent has a friend.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1412ws.at2   But she won't help you now, Vincent Valentine!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1413hj.at2   But she won't help you now, Vincent Valentine!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1414hj.at2   [yell, gasp]
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1415hj.at2   Why you!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1416ws.at2   Utilizing the Protomateria to draw forth Chaos while maintaining your human form!?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1417hj.at2   Utilizing the Protomateria to draw forth Chaos while maintaining your human form!?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1418ws.at2   Interesting. Let's see what you are capable of.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1419ws.at2   But even with the power of Chaos, you won't be able to stop me--stop Omega.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1420vn.at2   Hojo.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1421hj.at2   Huh?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1422vn.at2   I said I've heard enough.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1423hj.at2   What!?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1424vn.at2   It's time to end this. Right here. Right now.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1425ws.at2   You-- You insignificant fool!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1426hj.at2   You-- You insignificant fool!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1501hj.at2   Why!? Why is Omega's power fading? Why?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1502nr.at2   Weiss.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1503hj.at2   What is going on?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1504nr.at2   Weiss.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1505hj.at2   Impossible!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1506hj.at2   Get out of me!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1507hj.at2   Omega's host must be pure!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1508hj.at2   Why do you think I had you create mako untainted by Jenova!? If a filthy being like you infected it...
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1510nr.at2   Silence.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1511hj.at2   What?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1512nr.at2   Silence! I'm speaking with my brother.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1513hj.at2   You're what?
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1514nr.at2   Dear Weiss...
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1515ws.at2   Nero.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1516hj.at2   No!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1517nr.at2   Brother, let us become one. Let us come together, so that none may ever tear us apart.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1518ws.at2   Yes. Let us...
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1519nr.at2   Weiss...
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1520ws.at2   Nero...
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1521hj.at2   No! Stop it! You can't! This is my body now!
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1522ws.at2   Let us go join him.
event/scene/ev1010/sound/a1523hj.at2   No!
event/scene/ev1060/sound/b0101yf.at2   Vincent!
event/scene/ev1060/sound/b0102yf.at2   We did it!
event/scene/ev1060/sound/b0103yf.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev1060/sound/b0104yf.at2   Vincent!
event/scene/ev1060/sound/b0105yf.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev1100/sound/a1301sk.at2   Vincent!
event/scene/ev1100/sound/b0201sk.at2   Omega has awoken.
event/scene/ev1100/sound/b0202sk.at2   And Chaos has been drawn out of the shadows to serve as a counterbalance.
event/scene/ev1100/sound/b0203sk.at2   Or so it would seem.
event/scene/ev1100/sound/b0301sk.at2   JP
event/scene/ev1100/sound/b0302sk.at2   However...
event/scene/ev1100/sound/b0303sk.at2   In theory, the souls that exist inside Omega should act as a type of virtual network.
event/scene/ev1100/sound/b0304sk.at2   It wouldn't be impossible, but maybe I could...
event/scene/ev1100/sound/b0305sk.at2   [sigh]
event/scene/ev1100/sound/b0306sk.at2   Vincent, be grateful that I not only uploaded Lucrecia's thoughts, but her wishes and dreams as well.
event/scene/ev1100/sound/b0307sk.at2   Uplink successful. Now commencing SND.
event/scene/ev1110/sound/b0308sk.at2   JP
event/scene/ev1110/sound/b0309lc.at2   JP
event/scene/ev1110/sound/b0310kh.at2   [Chaos]

event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0401lc.at2   No. It's still not enough. I have to hurry or the tissue will continue to decay.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0402lc.at2   [effort]
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0403hj.at2   I see. Another experiment?

event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0405hj.at2   You're using this fine specimen to...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0406lc.at2   No!
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0407lc.at2   You're wrong! You're wrong! You're wrong!
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0408lc.at2   I...!
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0410lc.at2   Experiment?
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0412lc.at2   I found it.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0413lc.at2   With him.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0414lc.at2   That's why...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0415lc.at2   Proof?
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0416lc.at2   I.. I couldn't save him.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0417lc.at2   Never again...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0418hj.at2   [Laughing]
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0419lc.at2   [gasp, effort]
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0420lc.at2   Hojo. What have you...?
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0422vn.at2   Lu...cre...cia.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0423lc.at2   [gasp, effort]
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0424lc.at2   You had his eyes.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0425lc.at2   I didn't...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0426lc.at2   I didn't want to remember.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0427lc.at2   I didn't want to see it through...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0428lc.at2   I pushed you away, but...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0429lc.at2   Now I realize...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0430lc.at2   I never wanted to lose you.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0431lc.at2   Not again. Not today.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0432lc.at2   Vincent, did you know
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0433lc.at2   that your eyes are exactly like your father's?
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0434lc.at2   I've done it.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0435lc.at2   Born of the Lifestream.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0436lc.at2   Bringing all together.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0437lc.at2   Stopping the imminent decay of tissue.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0438lc.at2   But instead...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0439kh.at2   [Chaos]
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0440lc.at2   born was...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0441lc.at2   the chaos that took him...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0442lc.at2   away from me.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0443kh.at2   [Chaos]
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0444lc.at2   Stop...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0445lc.at2   Stop!
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0446lc.at2   This...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0447lc.at2   The materia...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0448lc.at2   We found together.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0449lc.at2   I found...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0450lc.at2   No!
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0451lc.at2   What am I doing?
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0452lc.at2   [sigh]
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0453lc.at2   Give him back!
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0454lc.at2   Give my son back!
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0455hj.at2   And how is your experiment proceeding?
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0456lc.at2   I don't know!... I don't know! I don't care!
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0457lc.at2   Let me see him! Just once!
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0458lc.at2   I'm so sorry. I can't...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0459lc.at2   I'm sorry.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0460lc.at2   I can't take it anymore.
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0461lc.at2   My body... My mind...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0462lc.at2   Before I go...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0463lc.at2   Must leave...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0464lc.at2   Record...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0465lc.at2   For him...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0466lc.at2   Wait...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0467lc.at2   For... who...?
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0469lc.at2   Vincent...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0470lc.at2   I love...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0471lc.at2   It was wrong...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0472lc.at2   ...so sorry...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0473lc.at2   ...but I...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0474lc.at2   Survive...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0475lc.at2   Hope...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0476lc.at2   Jenova's cells...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0477lc.at2   Stored as data...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0478lc.at2   Thought...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0479lc.at2   Memory copy...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0480lc.at2   Disperse...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0481lc.at2   Apply...
event/scene/ev1120/sound/b0482lc.at2   Fragment...
event/scene/ev1160/sound/b0516sk.at2   You're late.
event/scene/ev1160/sound/b0517vn.at2   Sorry about that.
event/scene/ev1160/sound/b0518sk.at2   Not that I mind, though.
event/scene/ev1160/sound/b0519vn.at2   She...
event/scene/ev1160/sound/b0520vn.at2   She was always like that.
event/scene/ev1160/sound/b0521vn.at2   Only believing what she wanted to.
event/scene/ev1160/sound/b0522sk.at2   So Vincent, why don't you try telling her that yourself?
event/scene/ev1160/sound/b0523vn.at2   Maybe I will.
event/scene/ev1160/sound/b0524vn.at2   But before that, I have a story to end.
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50301ct.at2   This has got to be the place!
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50302wl.at2   [crowd yelling struggle]
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50303ct.at2   What?!
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50304ct.at2   Good gracious me!
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50305ct.at2   What... What in the blazes is growing down there?
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50306nr.at2   Usher of souls.
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50308nr.at2   My brother.
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50309nr.at2   Omega.
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50310ct.at2   It's Nero the Sable. Oh dear...
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50312ct.at2   I can't let anybody find me!
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50313ct.at2   I could probably make it in there!
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50314ct.at2   JP
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50315ct.at2   JP
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50316ct.at2   Hm... maybe I can...
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50317ct.at2   Oh! That's the same container I saw in Kalm!
event/scene/ev1200/sound/50318wl.at2   [crowd screaming struggle]
event/scene/ev1200/sound/a0949hj.at2   So I had my minions gather up the "uncontaminated" to create a stream of refined mako, thus awakening Omega inside me.
event/scene/ev1200/sound/a0950hj.at2   Genius, I tell you. Pure genius. Pure genius.

event/scene/ev1300/sound/40101vn.at2   Lucrecia.
event/scene/ev1300/sound/40102lc.at2   I'm so sorry.
event/scene/ev1300/sound/40103vn.at2   Why?
event/scene/ev1300/sound/40104lc.at2   Awake--
event/scene/ev1300/sound/40105vn.at2   Awake?
event/scene/ev1300/sound/40106lc.at2   I'm so sorry.
event/scene/ev1300/sound/60101vn.at2   I... I saw you again. It was the place... in the place we first met.
event/scene/ev1300/sound/60102vn.at2   But you were...
event/scene/ev1300/sound/60103vn.at2   No. I'm the one to blame..at2   I couldn't stop you that day.
event/scene/ev1300/sound/60104lc.at2   I...found... I gave... you...
event/scene/ev1300/sound/60106vn.at2   Lucrecia?
event/scene/ev1300/sound/60107lc.at2   I'm so sorry.
event/scene/ev1300/sound/90401lc.at2   Is this the place you spoke of?
event/scene/ev1300/sound/90402gm.at2   Yes. Deep within this grotto is where Chaos is destined to awake.
event/scene/ev1300/sound/90403lc.at2   [laugh]
event/scene/ev1300/sound/90404gm.at2   Wait!
event/scene/ev1300/sound/90405lc.at2   Come on, Dr. Valentine!
event/scene/ev1300/sound/90406gm.at2   Ha!
event/scene/ev1300/sound/90407gm.at2   The fountain isn't going anywhere.
event/scene/ev1300/sound/b0491lc.at2   Hello Vincent.
event/scene/ev1300/sound/b0492lc.at2   Something's wrong...
event/scene/ev1300/sound/b0493lc.at2   You see, this is me, but only in a sense.
event/scene/ev1300/sound/b0494lc.at2   It is merely a reflection created with my remaining data.
event/scene/ev1300/sound/b0495lc.at2   The real me crumbled away long ago.
event/scene/ev1300/sound/b0496lc.at2   Vincent. Do you remember our place? Under that tree?

event/scene/ev1400/sound/60901lc.at2   ...ent...
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60902lc.at2   Vincent...
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60903lc.at2   Vincent...
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60904lc.at2   Fall asleep here, and you might catch a cold.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60905vn.at2   [gasp, breath]
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60906lc.at2   [breath]
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60907lc.at2   Why are you so surprised? Is my face that hideous?
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60908vn.at2   No. I didn't... I'm sorry.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60909lc.at2   And how are you supposed to be my bodyguard if you're up here sleeping?
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60910vn.at2   The warm breeze... I was only going to rest my eyes for a minute.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60911lc.at2   Hm?
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60912lc.at2   Well, I have to admit, the breeze is quite comfortable.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60913lc.at2   However...
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60914lc.at2   I think you're in my seat.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60915vn.at2   Huh?
event/scene/ev1400/sound/60916lc.at2   Care to join me?
event/scene/ev1400/sound/90501sk.at2   [crying]
event/scene/ev1400/sound/90502sa.at2   Stop crying, Shelke.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/90503sk.at2   But... But...
event/scene/ev1400/sound/90504sa.at2   It's alright. Mom just returned to the planet. We'll see her again.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/90505sk.at2   We will?
event/scene/ev1400/sound/90506sk.at2   (Is this...?)
event/scene/ev1400/sound/90507sa.at2   Of course we will. Mom said everything in this world flows around in a circle. That means she'll come back someday.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/90508sk.at2   (No... Shalua?)
event/scene/ev1400/sound/90509sk.at2   [cry, effort]
event/scene/ev1400/sound/90510sa.at2   Mom wouldn't lie to us, right?
event/scene/ev1400/sound/90511sk.at2   Right.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/90512sa.at2   Right.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0497lc.at2   The warm breeze on our skin...
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0498lc.at2   I know that it no longer exists.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0499lc.at2   Things fade with time, as do many things in this world.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0500lc.at2   But there are some things that we cannot let disappear.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0501lc.at2   I finally...
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0502lc.at2   I finally realized my true feelings.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0503lc.at2   Even if you may never understand them.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0504lc.at2   Not that I mind, though.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0505lc.at2   [giggle]
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0506lc.at2   But...
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0507lc.at2   This isn't how it was supposed to be.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0508lc.at2   I... I've made too many mistakes.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0509lc.at2   And I've hurt you so, so much.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0510lc.at2   Why did I do what I did?
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0512lc.at2   I'm so sorry.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0514lc.at2   But I'm so happy you survived.
event/scene/ev1400/sound/b0515vn.at2   Lucrecia!!!
