    <div class="header"><h1>Chapter 10: Shinra's Dark Secret</h1></div>
    <p class="nar">Vincent proceeds forward a bit; in the distance he notices a bunch of Gargoyles fly up to him. For a long time, Vincent makes his way throughout the Deepground complex/city, with no story developments; just a lot of dungeon crawling.</p>
    <p class="nar">Eventually, something of note happens; a whirlpool of black energy suddenly appears behind Vincent! He tries to run away, but it engulfs him; he's surrounded by darkness, and it completely swallows him. Somewhere in the darkness, a small blip of light appears and gets larger. A girl's voice is heard.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">No. Don't let Chaos control you.</div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">You cannot be contained by his darkness because a part of you was born from it.</div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Find yourself. Regain control.</div>
    <p class="nar">The darkness disappears from around Vincent; we see him jump out of the darkness cocoon that had enveloped him.</p>
    <p class="nar">Scene change; somewhere else in the darkness that Vincent had just escaped from, we see Shelke, encased in a blue ball of energy (most likely generated by her Shield materia.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">As old as he is, and still acting like a helpless child.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I can see why Lucrecia had such a difficult time.</div>
    <p class="nar">Cracks begin to form in the Shield.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't know why I'm doing this.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I will die when my magic runs out, anyway.</div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Is this...?</div>
    <p class="nar">Shelke looks up and gasps.</p>
    <p class="nar">Scene change; we see the "girl" was Lucrecia. It's another flashback; it's a flashback to when she first discovered the cave that would later be known as "Lucrecia's Cave"; the crystal formation is there as well.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Is this the place you spoke of?</div>
    <p class="nar">An older man is standing beside Lucrecia. His clothes slightly resemble Vincent's current attire, though they're almost entirely black.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Man:</h4><p id="dialog">Yes. Deep within this grotto is where Chaos is destined to awake.</div>
    <p class="nar">Lucrecia runs towards the crystals & giggles.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Man:</h4><p id="dialog">Wait!</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Come on, Dr. Valentine!</div>
    <p class="nar">Dr. Grimoire Valentine goes "heh"</p>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">The fountain isn't going anywhere.</div>
    <p class="nar">Scene change; we're in the laboratory of Shinra Manor, Grimoire is standing by Lucrecia's side as she works on the computer; a ball of dark energy appears to be festering inside one of the regenerative tubes.</p>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">Don't you think you are taking things a little too quickly?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">And why not? All those people at Shinra who laughed at my thesis... I have to prove them wrong!</div>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">Rushing into matters will get you nowhere, Doctor.</div>
    <p class="nar">Grimoire looks at the black ball of energy and goes "Hmm?" The black ball soon expands, filling the tube. Lucrecia gets up from her computer, as the energy cracks the tube.</p>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">Look out!</div>
    <p class="nar">Grimoire shoves Lucrecia out of the way, as the dark energy hits him in his right hand/arm. Lucrecia gets up and rushes to his side.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Are you alright, Dr. Valentine?</div>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">I'll be fine.</div>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">I'll be...</div>
    <p class="nar">Scene change; no idea where we are now (the background is black), but Grimoire is on his back and Lucrecia is by his side. His eyes are closed and green particles are floating upward from his body.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Dr. Valentine!</div>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">Tell my son that I'm sorry.</div>
    <p class="nar">Lucrecia shakes her head.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Dr. Valentine! Dr. Valentine!</div>
    <p class="nar">He looks at her, as the green particle-evaporation quickens.</p>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">My time has come to return to the Lifestream.</div>
    <p class="nar">He disappears.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">No!</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">No! Come back! Why did you have to fade away!? Why did you...</div>
    <p class="nar">The camera pans out and we see Shelke is observing a crying Lucrecia.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">It's alright. He simply returned to the planet.</div>
    <p class="nar">Scene change; still clearly a flashback, someone is crying over a cross draped with flowers, though we don't see who... we just see the cross.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Stop crying, Shelke.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">But... But...</div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">It's alright. Mom just returned to the planet. We'll see her again.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">We will?</div>
    <p class="nar">She turns around, and we see the Girl in question is a younger Shalua.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">(Is this...?)</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Of course we will.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">(No... Shalua?)</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Mom said everything in this world flows around in a circle. That means she'll come back someday.</div>
    <p class="nar">The younger Shelke stops crying.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Mom wouldn't lie to us, right?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Right.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Right.</div>
    <p class="nar">Back to the present, Shelke is still dreaming or hallucinating.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Shalua...</div>
    <p class="nar">Shalua appears beside her.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Shelke.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Is it alright for me to return to the planet?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">No...</div>
    <p class="nar">Shalua looks at her.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Not yet. There's still so much I...</div>
    <p class="nar">Shalua pets her hair.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Don't worry. We'll see each other again.</div>
    <p class="nar">We see Shelke is still inside her cracked Shield; she wakes up.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">A dream?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">No... Data interference.</div>
    <p class="nar">One teardrop rolls down her cheek; then another on the other cheek. She wipes the first one away.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I didn't think I had any tears left.</div>
    <p class="nar">Back to Vincent, who's staring at the swirling dark energy he escaped from. He turns around and continues on: gameplay resumes, and he continues through Deepground's complex. Eventually he reaches a gateway, which puts him one step closer to Mako Reactor 0. But plumes of dark energy are scattered about, which can only mean...</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">A pleasure to finally meet you, Vincent.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Nero.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">At first, I thought you nothing more than a nuisance. However, it seems I can no longer let you run about unchained. I must protect my beloved brother.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Your brother?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Dear Weiss. Powerful Weiss. The only person who ever loved me. And the only person I will ever love.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">However...</div>
    <p class="nar">Nero hangs his head.</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog"><em>[Sighs]</em> But that is all forgotten. In a matter of moments, everything will change.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">What did you do with Shelke?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Shelke?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Ah yes, what did I do with her? I do recall running into the lass when I journeyed to the airship. A feisty one, she is.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">The girl is inside me, lost like a little puppy.</div>
    <p class="nar">Vincent lifts his gun, Nero goes "Ah"</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">So you wish to dance?</div>
    <p class="nar">Nero quickly draws both of his gun. You're thrown into a boss battle vs. Nero the Sable! A remarkably easy boss fight, too. Afterwards, Nero's on the ground; he gets up.</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Impressive. Perhaps Azul and Rosso never stood a chance against the mighty Valentine.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">But enough. I have other matters to attend to.</div>
    <p class="nar">Nero engulfs Vincent in darkness; the scene changes to Shelke, also in the darkness, with her cracked Shield-bubble losing strength.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">So this is the end.</div>
    <p class="nar">Someone is there; she looks up. It's Vincent!</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">I think you dropped this.</div>
    <p class="nar">Shows her her cellphone.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Unless you find something appealing about this place, I suggest we leave.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Let's go.</div>
    <p class="nar">She nods.</p>
    <p class="nar">Back on the battlefield, Nero is observing the darkness that he sent Vincent into. He begins to walk away, but out come Vincent & Shelke. Nero turns around.</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">I see.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Soul wrought of terra corrupt.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">My darkness would have no control over you, would it?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">So I must try a different dance.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">How about...</div>
    <p class="nar">He generates a large cloud of darkness behind him, but is quickly distracted as a shuriken hits the ground near his feet. We see Yuffie high above, sporting her "mysterious ninja" garb from the Shinra Manor.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Even in a world where fear and despair reign over the heavens, you must never forget--where there is shadow, there is always light!</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">That's right!</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Bask in my rays, evildoers!</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Feel the radiance of Wutai Super Ninja, Yuffie Kisaragi!</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Back and ready for action!</div>
    <p class="nar">Awkward silence.</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">My brother calls.</div>
    <p class="nar">He turns around and disappears in his darkness. Vincent looks at Shelke, who's sprawled on the ground.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Are you alright?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I...</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't know.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Maybe I was dreaming.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Hey!</div>
    <p class="nar">Waves her hands.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Over here, guys!</div>
    <p class="nar">Trips due to the hand-waving; falls down hard. Vincent sighs.</p>
    <p class="nar">Scene change; inside some room of the Deepground complex. Apparently here they have regenerative tubes, because Shelke is presently in one. Yuffie is by Vincent's side.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Will you be alright?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Yes.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Okay! Now, let me see if I've got this. You keep going, find Nero and Weiss, and smack 'em into next Tuesday.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">And while you're cleaning house, I sneak into the reactor and shut her down.</div>
    <p class="nar">Yuffie twirls.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Sounds like a plan.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">So, see ya around, Vince!</div>
    <p class="nar">She runs off. Vincent begins to walk away, but...</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine.</div>
    <p class="nar">He turns back to face her. The camera pans out, and we see a nearby computer terminal state "Discoverer" followed by "Grimoire Valentine"</p>
    <p class="nar">Flashback. Vincent walks into the laboratory in Shinra Manor.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia? Hello?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Anybody here?</div>
    <p class="nar">As he looks around, he sees a computer terminal that profile's Grimoire Valentine's Shinra bio.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Father?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Who's...!?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia. This file...</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">It's none of your business.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">But it is. Why didn't you tell me you worked with my father?</div>
    <p class="nar">He reaches for her arm, she smacks his hand away.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Stop it! Just stop it!</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia...</div>
    <p class="nar">The background is now black; we only see Lucrecia and Vincent.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I... It was all my fault.</div>
    <p class="nar">We see Lucrecia and Vincent are now holding hands. She's on the verge of sobbing.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I didn't mean for your father to die. I couldn't... I'm so sorry.</div>
    <p class="nar">She starts to cry and runs away; Vincent just stands there.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">But I never blamed her. All I wanted was to see her smiling face.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">But after that day, the light left her heart.</div>
    <p class="nar">The camera pans away from Vincent. We see Lucrecia facing Hojo, as a light shines on him.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">So you've come to your senses and chosen me.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Yes, doctor.</div>
    <p class="nar">She hugs him.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">However, if she is happy, then I don't mind.</div>
    <p class="nar">Fade out on Lucrecia and Hojo embracing, and Vincent standing around like the lonely sorry bastard he is.</p>
    <p class="nar">Back to the present; Shelke's wakes up inside the tube.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Another dream?</div>
    <p class="nar">Vincent is standing in front of her.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Why are you fighting this battle?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">To destroy Deepground and stop Omega's return.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">It's time that an end is put to this madness. Or at least, that is what I tell myself.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Though I'm not completely sure that's the reason.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Not sure. Neither am I.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">But, Vincent... I don't want to see the world end. I just don't want there to be any more pain.</div>
