    <p id="nar">A portion of Meteor sticks itself through the smoke and clouds above Midgar. Rescue workers are evacuating the city and carting off the dead amidst harsh Meteor-generated winds.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Come on! Hurry up!</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">And try not to drop anybody this time!</div>

    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">We're all done here. How about you?</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent approaches the base of the Sister Ray.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Finished.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">But Yuffie, I want you to check the mako cannon.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">But we already...</div>
    <p id="nar">She looks up at the cannon, holding an electronic device which scans for life signs.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">What the...?</div>
    <p id="nar">The screen of the device flashes "Detected Life Signs 01"</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Just as I thought.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Hold on! Hold on! This is crazy.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">There's no way anybody could be up there. No.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Yuffie. Rendezvous with Cloud and the others.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">It looks like I still have some work to do.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent hangs up.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Hey, whoa!</div>
    <p id="nar">She lowers the phone and looks up at the cannon.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Get out of there! I have a bad feeling about this!</div>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/03.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/04.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent runs up to the top of the cannon, reaching the area where the group fought and defeated Hojo in the original game. Bright white light surrounds Vincent as the camera panes around to reveal... Hojo, slumped over the controls of the cannon, not moving. Vincent stares at him with utter hatred, and pulls out his tripled-barreled gun, Cerberus. Just as he's about to fire, a stray lightning bolt strikes the gun, distracting him. When he looks back up, Hojo isn't there. Unsure whether it was a hallucination or not, Vincent is given no time to ponder as a secondary explosion occurs nearby.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent!</div>
    <p id="nar">She approaches on some sort of hoverbike. Vincent jumps on and they fly away. On the computer screen that Hojo had previously been near, the words "start" and "fragment program" appear, flashing.</p>
    <p id="nar">"Three years later" flashes on the screen.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/05.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/06.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent is sitting in Lucrecia's cave, facing down. He looks up to see Lucrecia, encased in crystals with her eyes closed and hands placed on her chest. Vincent thinks the following lines.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">So...</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">We meet again...</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia.</div>
    <p id="nar">Some strange, subtle fluctuations appear around her. The screen fades to black.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm so sorry.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent opens his eyes; he's in a room in Kalm.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Why?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm the one who should apologize.</div>
    <p id="nar">A noise in the background signals the start of a television news program. We see Vincent's cell phone with a message to Vincent, from Reeve, stating "Meet me in Kalm. We need to talk." An anchorman begins the news story.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Anchorman:</h4><p id="dialog">Three weeks ago our crew left for Midgar.</div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Anchorwoman:</h4><p id="dialog">However, the group's whereabouts still remain unknown. What really happened down there?</div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Anchorman:</h4><p id="dialog">Tonight, for the first time, we bring you the final transmission received...</div>
    <p id="nar">Footage appears on the television screen; beneath it is the text "A television crew and 38 members of an investigation team are believed missing". The Anchorman and woman describe how, for the past three years, a door had remained sealed but was now being opened; a door leading to an area beneath the Shinra building, another of the company's secrets revealed recently. They note that there is evidence that "thousands of people had once been transported here"</p>
    <p id="nar">While the Anchorwoman continues to jabber on, Vincent looks out his window, up at the moon. The people in Kalm appear to be celebrating something; fireworks explode in the sky, and the streets are bustling with human activity and balloons. People are dancing. It's a very happy and festive time... and we cut back to Vincent, sitting in his solitary room. Suddenly he jerks his head to look outside once more - a missile of some sort has been launched at a building, exploding amidst the screams of frightened citizens in the streets. One guy exclaims "What the heck was that?!" A trio of helicopters fly overhead. With the aid of bungee cord-like devices, several soldiers drop out, detach, and run amongst the crowd, opening fire.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/07.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/08.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">Another batch of helicopters arrive, carrying large containers. Some bizarre dog-like mutant creature runs towards someone and bites their chest, dragging him away. Vincent is shown standing in his window, as a helicopter descends directly in front of him and fires a missile. His room explodes into flames as he jumps in the air and fires at the helicopter repeatedly, destroying it. We're shown one of the soldiers ordering a little girl clutching a teddy bear to "get in there!", "there" being one of the aforementioned containers. People are being herded into containers as the city burns around them. Vincent is pissed off.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-container" class="content">
    <div id="header"><span>Chapter 1: Sea of Flames</span></div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">What's going on?</div>
    <p id="nar">A trio of soldiers approach on the rooftop behind Vincent. From their line of vision we see a sort of computer screen with the words "Vincent Valentine", "Gender: Male", "Blood Type: A" at the top left of the screen. We cut to a scene of a girl with an elaborate device covering the top half of her head.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Found you.</div>
    <p id="nar">The camera pans out as we see she's plugged into a collection of wires. Back to the soldiers, whose screen notifies that Vincent is wanted Dead or Alive. They spring to action, but Vincent is faster and shoots them all down.</p>
    <p id="nar">The gameplay begins; Vincent traverses several rooftops, killing many of these soldiers, eventually reaching the ground.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Now where am I supposed to meet Reeve?</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent continues through the streets, saving civilians when he can, with dialogue that's unimportant to this script. We see a scene of a helicopter carrying away a container filled with people. Vincent goes about his business. We see a scene of a mother and daughter running away from a horde of dog-creatures; we see a similar screen as the guards who saw Vincent Valentine saw. The girl has a green tint with the word "Clean" beside her. The mother has a red tint with the words "Geostigma detected" beside her. One dog creature pins down the mother while another dog drags the girl away, and takes her inside a container. Vincent finds the container and frees her; the girl runs away crying "Mommy!", to which the mother replies "Rio!"</p>
    <p id="nar">Vincent continues through the town, saving civilians and generally killing a lot of bad guys. Eventually he gets to the town square.... and a helicopter faces him. Boss battle vs. Dragonfly. At the end of the battle the Dragonfly fires off a few missiles before crashing - Vincent dives into a nearby house via its open doorway to avoid them.</p>
    <p id="nar">Cut back to the girl with the strange headgear. She takes off the helmet.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine.</div>
    <p id="nar">A closeup of her face reveals her eyes are bright orange.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">We've found you.</div>
    <p id="nar">Her eyes return to a blue colour. A rather large brute approaches her from behind.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Guy:</h4><p id="dialog">Is this the one?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Yes.</div>
    <p id="nar">Back to Vincent, who makes his way through the house. On the 2nd floor, a loud crashing is heard; there's a big hole in the wall, and in walks the large brute from before. He's muscular, has blue hair and almost appears more beastly than human. The girl accompanies him.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/09.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/10.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">The Protomateria.</div>
    <p id="nar">Her eyes turn orange.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Tell us where it is.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent just looks at them.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Guy:</h4><p id="dialog">Hail Weiss.</div>
    <p id="nar">Several soldiers in the room also shout "Heil Weiss!"</p>
    <p id="nar">Gameplay: Vincent kills them all. Back to the large brute.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Guy:</h4><p id="dialog">Challenge accepted.</div>
    <p id="nar">The girl suddenly faints. He looks at her. A random voice off-screen says "This way!"</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Guy:</h4><p id="dialog">Luck is on your side.</div>
    <p id="nar">He picks up the girl and walks away.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm sorry.</div>
    <p id="nar">The brute turns around.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">I am Azul. We will meet again.</div>
    <p id="nar">The voice from before enters the room.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Guy:</h4><p id="dialog">What happened here!?</div>
    <p id="nar">In runs Reeve and a guy in a white uniform.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine! Are you alright?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Reeve, nice to see you again. Not a very interesting outfit, though.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog"><em>[laughs]</em> It took me a while to decide which costume I'd put on for today.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">But enough of the small talk. Who were those soldiers that just left?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't know. The large one called himself Azul.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Azul the Cerulean?</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Of the Tsviets!?</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Then that could only mean...</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Commissioner!</div>
    <p id="nar">Reeve turns around, and we see several enemy soldiers entering the ground floor of the house.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">We'll discuss this later. WRO troops have arrived and commenced rescue operations. We could use your help, Vincent.</div>
    <p id="nar">Reeve begins to walk away.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Reeve.</div>
    <p id="nar">Reeve stops and partially turns around.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't know what you are up to, but I want absolutely no part of it.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">But... You fought alongside us three years ago! We need your help once mor--</div>
    <p id="nar">A hail of gunfire bursts through Reeve's stomach; Vincent shoots down the enemy soldier, before running to Reeve's side.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Reeve!</div>
    <p id="nar">He goes to pick up "Reeve", who falls apart into several pieces. Out pops Cait Sith.</p>
    <div class="speech cait"><h4>Cait Sith:</h4><p id="dialog">That was a close one! Never was good at fighting. Luckily, I came out wearing "Reeve."</div>
    <div class="speech cait"><h4>Cait Sith:</h4><p id="dialog">You're really not a bad bloke, are you, Vincent? You pretend not to care, but you always come through in the end.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog"><em>[sighs]</em> Alright, what do you want me to do?</div>
    <div class="speech cait"><h4>Cait Sith:</h4><p id="dialog">Let's run those lads outta town. I'll leave the method up to you. When you've tidied things up, meet me at the square in front of the east church.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent departs the house and continues to go around Kalm, assisting the WRO and killing enemy units. To give you some insight as to who the WRO is, I'll include some optional dialogue Vincent can have with one WRO member.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Sir!</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">The WRO was originally established three years ago after Meteorfall.</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">With Jenova War hero Reeve Tuesti at its helm, our organization is dedicated to aiding the healing process of the planet, as well as protecting it from any who attempt further harm.</div>
    <p id="nar">Eventually he reaches an open area in front of a church. The Dragonfly from before shows up! Boss fight vs. Dragonfly GL. After the boss fight, Vincent jumps into the air, fires at the Dragonfly a few times, then, landing on top of it, transforms into the Galian Beast and punches it. He jumps off, the helicopter explodes, and he transforms back to Vincent. Enemy soldiers emerge from the vicinity and fire at Vincent; a truck drives in front of him, shielding him from the gunfire; WRO members pour out the back and return fire, accompanied by the real Reeve, who nods at Vincent. Vincent nods back.</p>
    <p id="nar">Scene change; relative calm has been restored to Kalm (no pun intended). Vincent sits on a crate while Reeve is talking to a WRO commander. At the end of the conversation they salute, followed by Reeve walking over to Vincent.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Good work, Vincent.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">The enemy is retreating. It seems they have finally begun their withdrawal from Kalm.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Good.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">However, we still require your assistance.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Reports are Edge is under attack.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent looks down... he's got a job to do.</p>
    <p id="nar">Scene change: two WRO members are taking cover behind crates. One of them is engulfed by black smoke.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Hey, toss me another clip.</div>
    <p id="nar">He turns around to see no one is there, before being engulfed himself. We see a group of four WRO Members running by, with the fourth one being engulfed by the smoke. The remaining three run into a warehouse.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Where did everyone go?</div>
    <p id="nar">A noise is heard above and the WRO Members look up. A scantily-clad girl with red hair and red eyes holding a weapon of some sort smirks at them. Her voice sports a slavic accent.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Who the hell are you!?</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Rosso. Rosso the Crimson.</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Tsviets?</div>
    <p id="nar">Her weapon opens up. Instantly she appears behind the three WRO members and in one broad move slashes them in their necks. They fall down.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">The mighty WRO...</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">They wouldn't last a day in Deepground.</div>
</div>
<div id="chapter-container" class="content">
    <div id="header"><span>Chapter 2: Showdown in the Wastes</span></div>
    <p id="nar">Reeve and Vincent are in a truck, traveling from Kalm to Edge.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Reeve. Who were those men?</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Deepground soldiers.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Deepground?</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Yes. The shadow of the Shinra Company, constructed by the former president and completely hidden from the rest of the world.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Constructed?</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">His goal was to create an army of superhuman warriors--not once letting morality interfere.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">The man you met earlier, Azul, is also a member of Deepground. But, he belongs to an elite unit known as the Tsviets.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">The whole organization was kept a secret. That is why there is so little information on them. However, it's nothing like I expected.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Not even a person in your position was informed?</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">No. Other than the president himself, the only people who knew of Deepground's existence were most likely Heidegger, Scarlet, and the head of biochemical research, Hojo.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">After the president's death, the transfer of power to his son was carried out so quickly, I doubt Rufus was ever briefed on the project.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">As for me, I was told the information was on a need to know basis. And as an official in charge of urban development, I guess I wasn't on their list.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">All the intel we currently have on Deepground was only discovered recently when we came across some of Scarlet's old files.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog"><em>[sighs]</em> Vincent. Have you heard of the mass disappearance that occurred recently in Junon?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">I remember the report saying that 20 or 30 people suddenly vanished.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">That's what the report would like you to believe.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">It was determined internally that if the truth was leaked, they wouldn't be able to contain the inevitable panic.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">The actual number of people that went missing that day was 1200. 1200 people simply vanished without a single trace.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">The WRO conducted a private investigation but we came up empty-handed. Except for the rumors.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Since the Junon disappearances, people in Edge have been on edge.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">They say that night after night you can hear screams coming from the direction of Midgar.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Could it be the wind? Let me ask you, does the wind sound like a thousand wailing souls?</div>
    <p id="nar">Awkward pause in the conversation.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Listen. Can you hear them? The cries?</div>
    <p id="nar">Some scattered voices can be heard in the distant background.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Commissioner! A rogue transmission is being broadcast on all wavelengths!</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent and Reeve look at the tv screen. A man is sitting in a throne. As he speaks the camera shows him from different angles.</p>

    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">What was that?</div>
    <p id="nar">He opens the back of the truck, just as a beast jumps up towards him; Vincent shoots it.</p>

    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">A WRO squad has already been dispatched to Edge. Join them and help liberate the city.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">I guess I have no choice.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent makes his way through the wasteland, killing Guard hounds and a boss, Crimson Hound. A little after, Deepground soldiers on hoverbikes attack him, and they get easily dispatched.</p>
    <p id="nar">Vincent has reached Edge; a rather grey and depressing town, currently in the midst of a rainstorm. It was here that Rosso slaughtered the WRO squad.</p>

    <p id="nar">Rosso is sitting on a crate in the factory, laughing to herself.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Slashed, strangled, and slaughtered. Beaten, stabbed, and crushed. Garroted and impaled. Shot and executed without mercy. Nicely said, Weiss.</div>
    <p id="nar">She looks up at the sky.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">I wonder if this will be a little more amusing than last time.</div>
    <p id="nar">The camera fades out, as we see she's surrounded by the corpses of WRO members.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/13.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/14.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">Back to Vincent, who's peering around a corner. A woman in a labcoat and high heels approaches him from behind and pulls out a gun. Vincent turns around, also holding his gun. Both guns are pointed at each other's heads. The girl is wearing a bizarre outfit beneath the labcoat; her left eye is closed and she appears to have an artificial left arm. Vincent notices a WRO identification tag on her labcoat.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">You're WRO?</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Who's asking?</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent puts his gun away.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine. Reeve sent me.</div>
    <p id="nar">The girl puts her gun away.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">My apologies. Shalua Rui of the WRO.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">The commissioner has told me much about you.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">What happened here?</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">That's what I'd like to know.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm here on other business, but something's not right. It's too quiet.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">I've seen no trace of Deepground, or the squads that were sent in to fight them.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Also, where are the 500 people who are supposed to still be living here?</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Well, this is getting us nowhere. Like I said, I have business to attend to. I'll see you around. <em>[she begins to walk away]</em></div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Business?</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog"><em>[stops, turns around]</em> The commissioner keeps telling me I'm wasting my time searching.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Searching for what?</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">For my reason to live. <em>[walks away]</em></div>
    <p id="nar">Back to gameplay; Vincent makes his way through the town, eventually stumbling on a solitary dying WRO member.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Ambushed... by... soldier... in red...</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Squad... wiped out...</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Warehouse... on the... edge of town...</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">They... were gathering... civilians...</div>
    <p id="nar">The gameplay continues. Vincent moves on to an area with snipers, and kills them all. Eventually he spots a lone kid running away from several Deepground soldiers; he kills them and saves the kid.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Kid:</h4><p id="dialog">Thanks.</div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Kid:</h4><p id="dialog">The warehouse. I know how to get there. It's through that gate.</div>
    <p id="nar">A nearby gate is revealed, which requires a cardkey to get by.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Kid:</h4><p id="dialog">You have the cardkey?</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent barely shakes his head to signal "no"</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Kid:</h4><p id="dialog">Come on. <em>[runs away]</em> I know someone who does. Follow me.</div>
    <p id="nar">Eventually Vincent gets the cardkey, and proceeds to the warehouse, where he's ambushed by a Heavy Armored Soldier and an array of Deepground soldiers, who (naturally) shout "Hail Weiss!" Boss fight vs. Heavy Armored Soldier.</p>
    <div class="speech heavy"><h4>Heavy Armored Soldier:</h4><p id="dialog">How could I...?</div>
    <p id="nar">The soldier falls down; Vincent walks to the door.</p>
    <p id="nar">Scene change; outside, Rosso is staring upward, standing in the rain.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">You know, this is the first time I've ever felt the rain on my skin.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">But then again, I hadn't even seen the sky until a few days ago.</div>
    <p id="nar">She stands there motionless for several seconds; the camera pulls back to reveal Vincent is standing there, looking at her.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">So you're Vincent Valentine. Keeper of the Protomateria.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Protomateria?</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Yes. The key to controlling Omega. We know you have it.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Hand it over now, and I'll kill you quickly.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent stares at her. He is unamused!</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Not one to bargain, are we? Then I'll make sure you suffer.</div>
    <p id="nar">Using her super-speed, she appears behind Vincent.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Time to die.</div>
    <p id="nar">She unfurls her weapon and attempts to strike him; Vincent dodges her blows; the center of her weapon is revealed to be a hidden gun; he manages to dodge the gunfire. However, she gets close enough to punch him, sending him crashing through a wall. Crouched on one knee, Vincent begins to glow red... he steps out of the building, now sporting a pair of wings, grey skin, and a generally macabre appearance. He is... Chaos! He generates a spherical red barrier of energy around him, which sends Rosso flying away. We next see Vincent standing in the rain, and he falls down. As he loses consciousness, he sees Shalua approaching him.</p>
    <p id="nar">Next scene: a flashback, or perhaps a hallucination, but he's in Lucrecia's Cave. The camera pans around Lucrecia, still in her crystal tomb, as we occasionally hear her disembodied voice.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">...sorry...</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Why?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Awake--</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Awake?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm so sorry.</div>
    <p id="nar">Another flashback; Vincent, as a Turk, is in the basement of Shinra Mansion, confronting Hojo, who's wielding a gun.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Talk! Why did you let this happen!?</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Silence.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">You!</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Silence!!! <em>[Hojo shoots him, Vincent falls down, staring at Hojo's boots]</em></div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Why can't these people just keep quiet?</div>
    <p id="nar">As Vincent begins to lose consciousness, he hears portions of what Hojo is saying to himself.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">I can... body... next experiment... a genius... I am... success here... justify... failures...</div>
    <p id="nar">Next scene; Vincent wakes up, his vision distorted. He stumbles around before the screen fades to black and he screams.</p>
    <p id="nar">Another scene change; he's inside a regenerative tube of water, while Lucrecia is outside, looking at him. This will be a familiar scene in future flashbacks; but for the moment, this is all we see.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-container" class="content">
    <!-- Chapter 4 -->
    <div id="header"><span>Chapter 4: Headquarters Under Siege</span></div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent is inside a tube of water, much like the previous scene, but in the present day. He wakes up and stares forward; Shalua is sitting at a desk in front of him.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Well, look who's awake.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent looks around.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Hold on. I'll release you.</div>
    <p id="nar">He gets released.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Where am I?</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Safe inside the WRO headquarters.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">I carried you back here from Edge after you collapsed during your fight with Deepground.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">It seems like the beast inside you went a little wild back there. This happen often?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Went wild? Do you mean Chaos?</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Chaos? Your body harbors the Chaos gene?</div>
    <p id="nar">Shalua begins to walk around as she talks.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">So that explains your relationship with Dr. Lucrecia Crescent.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Were you the product of one of her experiments?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia's experiments? <em>[He looks down]</em></div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">I apologize. That wasn't what I meant.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Wait. Lucrecia was researching Chaos?</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog"><em>[looks at him]</em> Don't tell me you didn't know.</div>
    <p id="nar">She sits down at her computer and types in a few keys. Information appears on the screen.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Crescent. Shinra class A scientist specializing in biotechnology.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">In her research thesis, "The Planet's Pulse," she refers to Chaos as one of the sentient xenoforms residing among us.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">However, the theories that she presented in her work were so abstract and complex...</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent zones out as Shalua continues talking in the background. He hears Lucrecia's voice once again say "I'm so sorry.", followed by "Awaken."</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Are you alright?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Can I see that thesis?</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Unfortunately, no. On top of being obscure, it was never even submitted to the Shinra database. All I know is what I saw while going through the company's archives.</div>
    <p id="nar">Reeve walks in.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent! Have you recovered already?</div>
    <p id="nar">Scene change; the little girl who accompanied Azul in Kalm is typing on a computer. Azul approaches her from behind.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">What is the status of our keeper?</div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">His location remains unchanged since the confrontation. We can assume this is the WRO headquarters.</div>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Good. Two birds with one stone.</div>
    <p id="nar">He walks away; she stands up, turns around and picks up an orange materia sitting on a nearby table, before leaving the room.</p>
    <p id="nar">Back to Reeve, Vincent and Shalua; apparently Vincent has recited his story to the other two.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">So Rosso the Crimson told you that Protomateria is the "key to controlling Omega"?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Yeah.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Any ideas?</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Soul wrought of terra corrupt, quelling impurity, purging the stream to beckon forth an ultimate fate. Behold mighty Chaos, Omega's squire to the lofty heavens.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Where did you...?</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">A passage from Dr. Crescent's thesis. But that's all I know. Unfortunately, I only saw a fragment of the document.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">However, Chaos... Omega... And... <em>[she looks at Vincent]</em> All seem to be connected to Dr. Crescent in some way. There's no other explanation.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">I think we'll need to gather more data on her to get anywhere.</div>
    <p id="nar">The computer screens surrounding them flash red & an alarm goes off.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">What now?</div>
    <p id="nar">Outside WRO headquarters, dozens of Deepground soldiers enter the building. Azul spots a video camera; a Deepground soldier shoots it down.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Damn!</div>
    <p id="nar">She types a few keys, causing doors inside the complex to close. Vincent exits the room. Outside, we see a couple of Deepground soldiers standing around.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Move.</div>
    <p id="nar">They move out of the way. He approaches a steel door; on the other side are 3 WRO soldiers. He punches a big hole in it.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Painless.</div>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Go.</div>
    <p id="nar">Deepground soldiers swarm into the complex. We next seen Vincent in a hallway, on his way to confronting them.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent! The enemy has breached the main gate! Hurry!</div>
    <p id="nar">Shalua looks at the video feed of the camera which was shot earlier. What's left of the video feed shows the little girl walking by. Shalua freaks out.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">What?</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">It couldn't be...</div>
    <p id="nar">Gameplay time. Vincent works his way through the floors of the WRO building, taking out various Deepground units. Eventually he reaches a WRO member who alerts him of the threat to Reeve.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Mr. Valentine! A sizable enemy unit is headed straight for the command center. Please, sir, you have to help the commissioner!</div>
    <p id="nar">Oh no, Reeve! Vincent races to the command center, where he encounters...</p>
    <div class="speech cait"><h4>Cait Sith:</h4><p id="dialog">Take that!</div>
    <p id="nar">A Deepground soldier gets thrown out. Cait Sith walks out of the room, followed by Reeve, their actions synchronized.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Don't worry. I'll be fine here.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">But Vincent. The Tsviets... Azul is still on the loose. <em>[Reeve and Cait Sith walk back into the room]</em></div>
    <p id="nar">Gameplay continues; Vincent backtracks, and notices Azul on the ground floor; he makes his way there, and then through some hallways, until he gets to a large room. As he's walking, we can see a cloaked person following him. Shalua, who's also in the room, spots the hidden being and pulls her gun.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Don't move.</div>
    <p id="nar">The cloaked being... is that little girl. She uncloaks and walks up to Shalua, who's still pointing a gun at her.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Very perceptive of you.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">I knew it.</div>
    <p id="nar">They look at it each other.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Shelke.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I have no acquaintances in the WRO.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">We've both changed so much. No, you haven't changed at all. Not in ten years.</div>
    <p id="nar">Shelke gasps.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Shelke. It's me. Shalua.</div>
    <p id="nar">Shelke turns away.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">I've been searching for you for so long.</div>
    <p id="nar">Shelke takes out her weapon, a pair of lightsabre-ish things with a tube connecting from one part of her wrist armor to another, and points one of the sabres at Shalua.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Don't take another step.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Shelke?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">It doesn't matter who I am or who you are. My current mission as a Deepground soldier is all that is relevant.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Even though ten years have passed, you're still Shelke, my only sister!</div>
    <p id="nar">Shelke lowers and disables her weapon.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Ten years. Has it been that long?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">The day they came to take me away, I was told I had potential.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">But those words were nothing but a precursor to a decade of suffering.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">They manipulated my mind until I was a shadow of my original self.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">The pain. The fear. For ten years I lived in a hell far deeper than any you could imagine.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">But look at me. I should be 19 this year.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">If I don't receive my daily dose of mako, this body wouldn't last a day.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">However, I don't consider myself the least bit unfortunate.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Except that for so long I held on to a foolish thread of hope that someday, someone would come to save me.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog"><em>[sobbing, as she falls to her knees]</em> I'm sorry, Shelke. I'm so sorry.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">It's time to put the past behind us. <em>[turns on her weapon]</em></div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Stop this!</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Reeve Tuesti.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">So you are Shalua's younger sister.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Excellent. Now I can terminate both of you at once.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Look at her. That's the price Shalua has paid fighting Shinra for the past ten years.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">She has given more than her arm, more than her eye. She has put her life on the line time and time again. All to find her lost sister.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">More than half her organs have been reconstructed.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Not a day goes by when Shalua doesn't suffer the pain of a hundred souls.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">But still, she...</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Enough. I've... I've heard enough.</div>
    <p id="nar">She prepares her weapon; Vincent pulls out his gun.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Stop!</div>
    <p id="nar">Reeve shoots at a sprinkler on the ceiling, which sets it off. Shelke moves forward to attack Shalua; Vincent runs to her side. Shelke stops her attack just in time.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent!</div>
    <p id="nar">The three of them leave the room as the sprinkler stops. Reeve reaches into his pocket.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Use these.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent takes what was given to him and re-enters the room.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Shelke? Shelke!</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Don't worry. The bullets will only sedate her. Let Vincent handle this.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent and Shelke square off. Boss fight vs. Shelke the Transparent. After the fight, she's unconscious from the sedation bullets.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Shelke!</div>
    <p id="nar">Shalua runs to her side and cradles her in her arms. Reeve and Vincent walk away.</p>
    <p id="nar">Gameplay. Vincent backtracks, but shortly thereafter stops; he turns around, as Azul comes crashing down through the ceiling.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">We meet again.</div>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Answer me this. Do you know why you even exist?</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent stares at him. Azul smirks.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Just as I thought. Ignorant to your own destiny.</div>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Very well. I'll show you what you really are.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent shoots at him, but it does nothing; a shield appears in front of Azul.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">You think that toy can penetrate my armor?</div>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Enough of the games, Vincent. Give me the Protomateria.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent! Over here!</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent fires at Azul a few more times before running away.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">You can't run!</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent and Reeve are running away; Azul is hot on their trail.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent!</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent looks at him and nods. They enter a large room; Vincent walks over to an extremely large gun/rocket launcher on the ground, picks it up & fires it at Azul. The explosion sends Vincent and Reeve backwards.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">You shouldn't leave those things lying around.</div>
    <p id="nar">Reeve laughs; Vincent looks at Azul, who's still standing, albeit shieldless, and now HE'S holding the gun/rocket launcher. He's also laughing menacingly.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Well done. You have broken through my barrier.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">This ends here. Leave him to me. <em>[Reeve leaves]</em></div>

    <p id="nar">Vincent lands in the sewer system. He makes his way forward, and it becomes clear that he's not alone... as a Sahagin jumps in front of him!</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Looks like I'm not the only one here.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent clears the sewers, and exits them, arriving in some storage area beneath the basement of the Shinra Manor. He gets in an elevator and, arms crossed, has a flashback to when he first met Lucrecia.</p>

    <div class="speech cait"><h4>Cait Sith:</h4><p id="dialog">This has got to be the place.</div>
    <p id="nar">Cait Sith evades the patrolling DG soldiers, jumping to a new area. A container from Kalm, filled with human brings, travels across a railing.</p>

    <p id="nar">On to another screen; Cait Sith arrives at a large pool of green liquid. A container (still filled with people) falls from above into the greenness.</p>

    <p id="nar">Cait Sith gets engulfed by black energy, as we see a Moogle doll floating on the surface of the green liquid.</p>
    <p id="nar">Back to Vincent, who's now in the basement of the Shinra Manor. He opens a door to reveal he's in the library & laboratory portion of the Shinra Manor, where Sephiroth's rage was first felt 8 years earlier. A small materia rolls on the ground and lands at his feet. He reaches down and picks it up; it shines brightly. He turns around: Lucrecia is standing there!</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia!</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent, right?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Have you come to check up on me?</div>
    <p id="nar">She walks forward, right through him. Her hologram flickers. They both turn around to face each other again.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Omega. His awakening is upon us.</div>
    <p id="nar">Screen fades to white; the scene changes to Lucrecia standing in the cave where she would later be interred in crystals.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Soul wrought of terra corrupt, quelling impurity, purging the stream to beckon forth an ultimate fate. Behold mighty Chaos, Omega's squire to the lofty heavens.</div>

    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Omega. The end.</div>
    <p id="nar">She faces the crystals and stretches out her hands, and a ball of energy begins to form at them.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Just as all other sentient beings, he too, is born of the Lifestream.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">However, his only purpose is to cleanse the planet of all things living and lead their immortal souls through the abyssal aether to a new beginning far, far beyond the neverending sea of stars.</div>
    <p id="nar">The ball of energy disappears.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Just as life circulates through our planet, so too, does our planet through the universe. Or at least in theory.</div>
    <p id="nar">We see Lucrecia amidst a sea of stars; outer space, if you will.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">However, what I can be certain of is, if Omega awakens, then all life as we know it will end.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">And when Omega has embarked on his journey to the cosmos, our planet will wither and die.</div>
    <p id="nar">Back to the present, and the Lucrecia hologram.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I will leave a copy of my records here for you, Vincent.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Though I cannot imagine what help they might be, if any at all.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Just remember...</div>
    <p id="nar">Lucrecia faces the ground.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I am so sorry.</div>
    <p id="nar">She disappears, and so does the materia in his hand.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia.</div>
    <p id="nar">He eyes a computer disc on a nearby table; he picks it up.</p>
    <p id="nar">Gameplay continues; Vincent makes his way around the Shinra Manor, killing DG units and collecting any files on the Omega Report he can find. At one point he enters a door, falls to one knee - and it's flashback time!</p>
    <p id="nar">Flashback: Vincent's inside the tube of liquid again, with Lucrecia looking at him; it's the exact same flashback as earlier. Scene cuts back to the present.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">This pain.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Well, well. We meet again.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">This is perfect. I so wanted to see you, my love.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Deepground. What are they attempting to do with Omega?</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't know. And to be honest, I don't care.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">What?</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">But this is what Weiss desires.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Hail Weiss.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">And what Weiss orders, we do. It is very simple.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">If he desires the awakening of Omega, then that is what all of Deepground desires.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">We could care less what happens to the planet.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">But all this matters little to me. It is not every day you are granted the chance to cleanse the world of all life.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Just the thought sends a chill of excitement through my body.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">The Deepground soldiers were born and bred to kill.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">We were chained to a destiny of servitude.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">But then three years ago, we were freed from our chains--though waiting for us was darkness lit only by the faint glow of mako.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">And what do you think we did when we gained our freedom?</div>
    <p id="nar">Rosso laughs.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">We killed. That is how we were raised. That is all we knew.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">And so I bathed in the blood of a thousand soldiers.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">And I enjoyed it. I reveled in it.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">And when I finally stepped out of the abyss, I craved for more.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">You understand, right?</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent points his gun at her.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't think so.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">How can you say that, darling? We're one and the same.</div>
    <p id="nar">She speeds away; Vincent follows, temporarily being delayed by a robot firing explosives. He eventually reaches the entrance to the Shinra Manor, where the stairs lead to the second floor. Boss Battle vs. Black Widow (the aforementioned robot)</p>
    <p id="nar">After the battle's conclusion, Vincent is standing around. Something is approaching fast from behind... he turns around, just as Rosso reaches him and jabs her hand directly into his chest. I mean, INTO. When she pulls it out, she's holding some uniquely-glowing materia... Vincent crouches on the ground.</p>

    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm sorry. Were you not expecting that?</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent is on the ground, spasming. His eyes, and then his whole body, glow red. He transforms into Chaos, but is still unable to move, and transforms back into Vincent.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">So, you cannot control the beast without this.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Well, there will be no need for it when I'm done with you.</div>

    <p id="nar">Rosso crouches down to finish off Vincent, but in runs some mysterious person with a big shuriken! The person flings the shuriken at Rosso, causing her to back away from Vincent. The shuriken spins around, and then it emits bright light, blinding Rosso... by the time the light dissipates, both the mysterious person and Vincent are gone.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Wutai flea!</div>
    <p id="nar">Rosso runs out of the manor, looking around franticly but seeing nothing. She punches the ground, flinging rocks everywhere.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">If you manage to survive that wound, I'll make sure you don't survive the next one.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">But no matter. <em>[She holds up the materia in her hand]</em> The end is upon us.</div>
    <p id="nar">Flashback. Hojo is sitting at a table while Vincent talks to him. For the record, the game never actually says Hojo says these lines, but it's obviously him.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Is it true?</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Is what true?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">That Lucrecia... That Dr. Crescent is to take part in this project?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">It's true. <em>[She walks into the room]</em></div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Why are you so surprised?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">But using your own child for an experiment?</div>
    <p id="nar">Hojo goes "Hah!"</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't know what you're implying, but both of us are scientists. We know what we are doing.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">You are the last person to have any word in this. Now leave us at once, boy!</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">But...</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">But what?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">If you have something to say, say it.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Are you... Are you sure this is what you really want?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Am I sure? Am I sure!? If this only concerns me, then yes, I am sure!</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">I just...</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent stares at the ground, and thinks the following.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">All I did was watch.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">I didn't even try to stop her.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">And then...</div>
    <p id="nar">Shot of Lucrecia walking... she begins to fall over and clutches her stomach in pain, as we see images of Jenova, the Holy materia falling down, and Sephiroth walking through the flames of Nibelheim - all images directly lifted from Advent Children. Screen fades to black.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">That was my sin.</div>

    <p id="nar">We see a WRO soldier keeping watch outside Azul's room. He thinks he hears a noise, and goes closer to it... only to be blasted backwards, along with the door, as a giant beast's foot steps out. Elsewhere, a DG soldier snipes two WRO members. Another sniper snipes two more. A soldier breaks though the glass ceiling, sniping two more members. The complex is utterly overrun with DG soldiers, killing everything in sight.</p>

    <p id="nar">Vincent dispatches of the trio of machines (which look like Custom Sweepers from the original game) that derailed his truck. He proceeds through the wilderness, killing Guard Beasts, DG soldiers, and strange bug creatures along the way. He encounters a group of WRO Members and assists them; then, together with the WRO Members, they destroy a group of Helicopters intent on attacking WRO Headquarters.</p>
    <p id="nar">Vincent proceeds to get closer to headquarters, eventually overhearing a transmission involving WRO Members, as they shout "This is headquarters. We need backup!" followed by ""Get away!", "What is that thing!?" and various screams followed by a beast's roar.</p>
    <p id="nar">As he reaches the entrance to the headquarters, he's confronted by several DG soldiers... and another Black Widow. Boss battle vs. Black Widow II. Once it's defeated, he enters the headquarters... when Vincent had last been there 2 chapters ago it was in fine shape, but now it's a shell of what it once was; pretty much everything's destroyed. It's a surprise it's still standing; the ground is shredded and fires ravage the entire complex.</p>
    <p id="nar">In one hallway, two WRO members are firing handguns at... something. Suddenly a 3rd member flies through the air and hits the two of them. We see the beast that has torn apart the complex. It's... very beastly!</p>

    <p id="nar">Once all three individuals have been talked to, the scene changes; everyone's on the bridge. It's meeting time!</p>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Alright. Our old buddies and the remaining WRO squads will lead the ground assault...</div>
    <p id="nar">Scene change; a lone truck is driving through the Wastelands. Barret is at the helm, with Tifa in the passenger seat.</p>
    <div class="speech tifa"><h4>Tifa:</h4><p id="dialog">I see it!</div>
    <p id="nar">The rear of the truck opens up. Cloud is sitting on his motorcycle; he puts his driving goggles on.</p>
    <div class="speech cloud"><h4>Cloud:</h4><p id="dialog">Time to go, Fenrir.</div>
    <p id="nar">He drives out of the truck, and then ahead of it; Cloud is leading the way.</p>
    <div class="speech barret"><h4>Barret:</h4><p id="dialog">Awright!</div>
    <div class="speech tifa"><h4>Tifa:</h4><p id="dialog">Yeah!</div>
    <p id="nar">As the camera pans out, we see the truck is just one of over a dozen, and the entire convoy is on a direct course to Midgar.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/46.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/47.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">Back to the meeting; Yuffie is holding a bag of ice to her forehead.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">...while we launch our attack from the air.</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Right. So Reeve, you ready?</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Yes.</div>
    <p id="nar">Scene changes to show Shelke about to put on her VR helmet again; Cait Sith is in the room with her.</p>
    <div class="speech cait"><h4>Cait Sith:</h4><p id="dialog">Alright. Take it away, Shelke!</div>
    <p id="nar">She puts it on and lies back in her chair.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Very well.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Data fragment link... successful. Commencing synaptic net dive in 3, 2, 1 ...</div>
    <p id="nar">She begins the dive. On the bridge, Cid, Vincent, Reeve and Yuffie are exposed to a hologram of the universe.</p>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">What the? Are we in...?</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">What? What?</div>
    <p id="nar">A distinct female voice-over recites Reeve's report.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Just as we return to the planet when our lifelight has faded, the planet returns to the cosmos when her time has come.</div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Anything that has definite shape will one day cease to exist. The same is true for this world.</div>
    <p id="nar">The quartet are exposed to an image of a trio of meteors striking the planet, spreading a wave of fire over it.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/48.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/49.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Before she takes her final breath, the pure Lifestreams that flow freely beneath her crust will be brought together into one by Omega--the ultimate lifeform. His purpose: to gather all life, sentient and non, and lead it into the sea of stars, where it will embark on a fabulous journey along a road untraveled.</div>
    <p id="nar">The lifestreams, which had been gathering at one point, blast off into the universe.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">However, when Omega has lifted the life from this planet, all that will remain will be an empty shell destined to die silently in the limitless void of space.</div>
    <p id="nar">The barren, lifeless world, begins to crack, then fall apart - very similar to Bugenhagen's demonstration of a lifeless planet from the original game.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/50.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/51.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">Back on the Shera's bridge; the universal light show has ended, and the female voice-overs are replaced by Shelke voice-overs.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Omega is the same type of life form as the Weapons we encountered three years ago.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">The planet gave birth to these creatures to protect itself just as the planet will ultimately give birth to the final Weapon, Omega, when the end of the world is imminent.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">In essence, Omega is an elaborate safety mechanism designed solely to maintain and protect the flow of life.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Normally, Omega poses no threat to us. It only manifests when the planet has detected something that may cause her danger.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">However, Deepground is attempting to awaken the beast early. Thus the kidnappings.</div>
    <p id="nar">Brief scene change; Cait Sith puts on the VR helmet, then waves to Shelke. She nods at him. The screen is black, and we hear the screams & cries of many people.</p>
    <div class="speech cait"><h4>Cait Sith:</h4><p id="dialog">Good gracious me!</div>
    <p id="nar">Scene changes back to the bridge.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">By slaughtering thousands of innocent souls, they are creating a pure Lifestream in order to trick the planet into thinking the "end" is near.</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Why, those conniving...!</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't know what this Weiss character is tryin', but he's crazy if he thinks we're gonna let him get away with it.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Right.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Omega is being revived deep beneath Midgar in Mako Reactor 0.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">To increase the output of Reactor 0, all the other reactors have been tied into its mainframe.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Our objective is to destroy 1 through 8 and slow the reanimation process.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Mission details for each squad will be relayed separately.</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Alright. We've still got some time before the big show.</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">You got anything needs tending to, do it.</div>
    <p id="nar">Back to gameplay; Vincent talks to Cid, who's back at the wheel of The Shera.</p>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Vince, don't worry about the reactors. We'll take care of them.</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">You work on those four wackos.</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't like letting you have all the fun, but you know I can't leave my baby here alone.</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Cloud and the others will be shutting down the power, and there's no way we're lettin' Yuffie go down there by herself.</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Sorry buddy. Looks like from here on out it's Vince versus the Tsviets.</div>
    <p id="nar">Cid faces Vincent, and puts his hand on Vincent's shoulder.</p>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">We're counting on you, old pal.</div>
    <p id="nar">Optional dialogue, but I'm including it anyways. If you talk to Cid again...</p>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Yeah, but just look at Cait... I mean, Reeve. When the hell did he become so important?</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">All this you see around you--everything here--he put up the gil for it.</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">'Course that's on the condition that I help him save the world.</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">What I want to know is where he got that kind of cash.</div>
    <p id="nar">Talking to Cid AGAIN, even more optional.</p>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">When all this is over, how about we grab a couple of cold ones. Just like the good ol' days, huh?</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Even Shera's been worried about you, and you know how she gets.</div>
    <p id="nar">Back to the laboratory to talk with Shelke.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">So tired...</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">What?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">This feeling. Is this what you meant by doing something for someone you care about?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">It seems so.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Dr. Crescent's data has begun defragmenting within my mind.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I can see many different images.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Images she experienced with you.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Interference... Recovery... So tired... <em>[She falls asleep]</em></div>
    <p id="nar">And back to the room where Reeve is sitting.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">So, no costume today?</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog"><em>[laughs]</em> Headquarters was pretty much destroyed by the Deepground forces.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">But I was able to salvage a few things.</div>
    <p id="nar">A Cait Sith approaches them.</p>
    <div class="speech cait"><h4>Cait Sith:</h4><p id="dialog">Number 6, ready for action!</div>
    <p id="nar">Talking to Reeve again, some more optional dialogue.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Tell me, Reeve. Who's backing your operation?</div>
    <div class="speech cait"><h4>Cait Sith:</h4><p id="dialog">Oh, that.</div>
    <p id="nar">Reeve laughs a bit.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Actually, I'm not sure. I have only met with a representative.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">However, the WRO is crucial for this planet's survival.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm not concerned with the reasons this person has for helping us, as long as he continues writing the checks.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Though, I have a feeling it is probably someone who believes he is in debt to the planet.</div>
    <p id="nar">And another convo with a still-heaving, still-airsick Yuffie.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Did you hear? They attacked Wutai as well.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Thanks to my dad and the Wusheng, things didn't turn out as bad as they could have, but... But I'm worried about my old man. He's not as young as he used to be.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">He's gonna have a heart attack one of these days, if not give me one!</div>
    <p id="nar">Talking to Yuffie again, optional dialogue.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Now, if I was there, dad wouldn't even have to put down his mai tai.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">What? What?</div>
    <p id="nar">Another optional convo...</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">I could take out Deepground with one hand tied behind my back! <em>[Starts to punch the air... then heaves]</em></div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent approaches a lower area of The Shera. He clutches at his heart, which begins to beat louder, and he hears a beast's roar... he looks at his hand as he begins to glow red. He's now in Chaos mode. He claws at a wall, and is about to go kill some people when...</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent.</div>
    <p id="nar">He turns around and sees Lucrecia standing there. He reaches out to her with his right hand. His arm glows, and he returns to being Vincent... the hallucination disappears.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">What's happening?</div>
    <p id="nar">He looks at his hands.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">A dream?</div>
    <p id="nar">He turns his head & notices the clawing of the wall. He gasps... and clutches at his heart once again, as it beats louder.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Am I losing control?</div>
    <p id="nar">Shelke is standing behind him... she walks away.</p>
    <p id="nar">Back on the bridge, the camera's on Cid.</p>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Okay dogs, it's time!</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">All hands to battle stations!</div>
    <p id="nar">Scene change: The sun is setting, as Azul, Nero and Rosso stand on the outskirts of Midgar.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">A simultaneous attack from land and air.</div>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">I think they may be serious this time.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">They had better be. I've been so bored lately.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">His awakening is near. Let tonight be the final chapter.</div>
    <p id="nar">Back in the Shera's hangar, as the WRO troops prepare for battle. Yuffie's there with them. Cid's voice blares over the intercom.</p>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Listen up, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once!</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">If any more of you are killed by those punks, I'll drag you back from hell and kill you again!</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">You really want to piss off those SOBs, then why not try stayin' alive!</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">That's what this war's all about!</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">If you live, everybody behind you lives. If you die, they die!</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">You got that? Now go kick some Deepground ass!</div>
    <p id="nar">Yuffie & Everyone else cheers.</p>
    <p id="nar">Scene change; Shelke talks to Vincent; Reeve is by their side.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine. <em>[hands him a phone]</em></div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">What's this?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Your phone. I retrieved it in Kalm.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I've modified it slightly. Just dial #VIN to contact my personal terminal directly.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">From this workstation, I can perform a synaptic net dive into almost any network system in Midgar.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I may also be able to help guide you into Deepground.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent looks at Reeve; he crosses his arms.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">It's not what you think.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">By monitoring your movement, Dr. Crescent's data fragments are restored within me.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm simply providing this service for my own benefit.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">I didn't say anything.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I... Anyway... my resources here are limited. Do not expect too much.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm counting on you, Shelke.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I... It's just I've never actually been "counted on" by anyone before.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Never mind.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Well then, can I "count on" you to keep an eye on the airship while we're away as well?</div>
    <p id="nar">Shelke gasps.</p>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">I have already witnessed your strength and skill once.</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">This is war, and we have to be ready for anything. Your assistance would be of great help.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">My assistance?</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Exactly.</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Commissioner!</div>
    <div class="speech reeve"><h4>Reeve:</h4><p id="dialog">Excuse me. Vincent, I will see you again before deployment. And Shelke remember, I'm counting on you.</div>
    <p id="nar">Reeve leaves; a few moments later, Vincent looks at Shelke and leaves too.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Fighting for...</div>
    <p id="nar">She shakes her head.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">No, I have no one to fight for. No one at all.</div>
    <p id="nar">She walks away.</p>
    <p id="nar">Oh man, it's FMV time. Cid punches one hand into his palm, all dramatic-like.</p>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">This is it!</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Go!</div>
    <p id="nar">The fleet of airships approach Midgar. Deepground is ready for them, as an array of helicopters, black widows, and hundreds of soldiers prepare to fire on them. A group of Heavy Armored soldiers launch a barrage of missiles, hitting a couple of airships; an airship returns fire, taking out several black widows. Gunfire and missiles fill the air; the bottom of an airship opens up, as a robotic female voice announces "Hatch open. Prepare for drop." Elsewhere, Shelke jumps into her chair and puts her helmet on.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">See you boys later!</div>
    <p id="nar">Yuffie and the other soldiers dive out of the airship on hoverboard-type devices.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Going down!</div>
    <p id="nar">Cut back to Shelke, who's monitoring the developments.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Advance squad away. Secondary squad, prepare for drop.</div>

    <p id="nar">The air battle rages on, as the fleet of trucks (and Cloud on his motorcycle) approach the city, while being heavily fired upon. Cloud leads the way.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/54.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/55.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <div class="speech tifa"><h4>Tifa:</h4><p id="dialog">Barret!</div>
    <p id="nar">Barret responds with a "Yo!" Cloud holds his sword in his right hand, while a stream of missiles fire from the top of Barret's truck, destroying all in their path. Cloud rides through the resulting firestorm. High above the action, Rosso sees Cloud approach. She giggles to herself, and jumps down. Cloud looks up in time to see Rosso, weapon unfurled, about to perform an epic spinning attack on him.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/56.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/57.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">A large explosion occurs at his motorcycle, and we next see Cloud and Rosso gliding through the air, both attempting to strike the other. The clash of their weapons results in a large energy shockwave.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/58.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/59.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">Elsewhere, Azul (with his large gun/rocket launcher in tow) fires into the air. The blast hits an airship. Which loses control and..</p>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">What the!?</div>
    <p id="nar">...collides with the Shera. A fire breaks out in the hatch area; Vincent and the WRO members dive out on their hoverboards just in time.</p>

    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Damn! They're gonna pay for that!</div>
    <p id="nar">A helicopter fires at Vincent; a few key gunshots causes it to explode. Vincent continues to glide down as he continues to be fired upon. After some more acrobatic moves, he successfully lands inside Midgar, starting at the Shinra Tower.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/62.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">Gameplay resumes; the sun has set and the sky is showing signs of twilight. The war still rages on around him. He sees a train in front of him; his phone rings & he answers.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">What do you think you're doing?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">You have landed several klicks off your target destination.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">However, considering the location of the enemy, this could work to your advantage.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Head for the central complex and locate a means of reaching the top level.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">You will only be able to enter Deepground from the upper platform.</div>

    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Sir...</div>
    <p id="nar">He turns around.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Requesting permission to accompany you until we have reached the complex!</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Do as you wish.</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Sir! Thank you, sir!</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent encounters another WRO Member, cowering behind a crate.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">I was just taking a breather.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent walks away.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Sir! Let me join you!</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Just don't get in my way.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent and the WRO Members continue through the Train Graveyard. At one point, a female WRO Member is crouched, gun ready, peering around a corner.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">You know, I was born in Midgar.</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">My brother and I used to play here all the time. My mom didn't approve, though.</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">After she died, my brother joined a Shinra resistance group, but was killed when the plate fell and...</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">I can't believe this place is still here.</div>
    <p id="nar">A different WRO Member runs up to them.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Lieutenant! Soldiers!</div>
    <p id="nar">The gameplay continues; eventually you run into a WRO Commander.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Commander!</div>
    <p id="nar">The Commander then speaks to you.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine! Thank you for your assistance!</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">To reach the central complex, you must proceed through this maze of decommissioned train cars.</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">However, I have received reports that beyond the graveyard are some of the enemy's most powerful defenses.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Alright. I'll see what I can do.</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Wait! I can't let you go without backup!</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">No.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">You heard what Cid said. Your job is to live. If you come with me, chances are you'll all die.</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Understood. I'll remain here until the current situation has improved. <em>[salutes]</em> Good luck, sir.</div>
    <p id="nar">Continuing on some more, until he finds yet another WRO Member, this time injured. The Member pulls his gun on Vincent, then lowers it.</p>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine.</div>
    <p id="nar">Camera fades out, then fades back in.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">There's no way out of here?</div>
    <div class="speech wro"><h4>WRO Member:</h4><p id="dialog">None. I looked all over, but I found nothing. It looks like we're both stuck in here.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent thinks for a moment, then pulls out his phone and calls someone, the 'someone' obviously being...</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Shelke.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine?</div>
    <p id="nar">Camera does the fade out & fade in thing from before.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">The only way out of the graveyard is through a nearby underground passage.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Where?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm uploading the location now.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Also, up ahead, Deepground has established a heavy line of defense.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">You probably won't even break a sweat, but I thought I would let you know.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent hangs up.</p>
    <p id="nar">He continues on, getting to another part of the Train Graveyard. His phone rings.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">You've reached the central complex. Proceed up to reach the plate surface.</div>
    <p id="nar">she gasps.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">What's wrong?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">The approaching Deepground squa-- No, it's nothing. I'll contact you agai--</div>
    <p id="nar">DG soldiers with jetpacks fly in from above.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Aerial troopers. Good luck, Vincent.</div>
    <p id="nar">Boss battle vs. Shrikes. Vincent easily takes them out, dispatching of the last one in a cutscene.</p>
    <p id="nar">Vincent makes his way through the complex, dispatching assorted soldiers and robots. Eventually he makes his way to the top, and there to greet him is... Rosso.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Still alive, I see.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">And you call yourself human?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">More human than you.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">More human than I? <em>[Laughs]</em> Tell me something I don't already know, darling!</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm a Tsviet! I traded away my human weaknesses for power long ago.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">It is the path I've chosen.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">And the path I'll tread.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Until I've sucked all life from this pitiful world!</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">And I'm not going to let you get in the way.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">You've lived long enough, Vincent Valentine.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">And I'll make sure you don't come back this time  by slicing you into pieces!</div>
    <p id="nar">She takes out her weapon. Boss battle vs. Rosso the Crimson. After you take off about a quarter of her health...</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Do you know why they call me "the Crimson," darling?</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Let me show you!</div>
    <p id="nar">Boss battle vs. Bloodburst Rosso - way faster and tougher! Still a cakewalk for Vincent. After the fight she's on the ground.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Someone stronger...</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">than...</div>
    <p id="nar">She slowly gets up.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Absurd...</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Absurd!</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">Our time here together is done.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">But the mighty Azul awaits.</div>
    <p id="nar">She runs to the edge of the platform.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">I shall not grant you the pleasure of killing Rosso the Crimson.</div>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">No one will ever stand above me!</div>
    <p id="nar">A beam of energy appears in her hand.</p>
    <div class="speech rosso"><h4>Rosso:</h4><p id="dialog">No one! No one! No one!</div>
    <p id="nar">After each "No one", she strikes the platform around her with the energy beam, forming the  shape of a square. Her part of the platform begins to fall down, and she cackles maniacally as she falls to her death.</p>
    <p id="nar">Vincent is walking, and picks up his phone.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine.</div>
    <p id="nar">We see Shelke is still sitting in her chair with the helmet on.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">The ground squads have not been able to penetrate the Deepground defenses.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">The mako reactors are still operating at full capacity.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">So it seems.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">What is your location?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Shinra building... or what remains of it.</div>
    <p id="nar">The building's wrecked, and on fire.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">The same as it was three years ago.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Though, after Meteorfall, there wasn't much left of Midgar at all.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">With the exception of Deepground.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">The passage to Deepground should be located within Shinra building.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Search for the president's personal entrance.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Alright.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent feels the pain in his chest again; he collapses the screen goes black, and we hear the howl of Chaos. It fades back in, and we see he's still Vincent, though he's dropped his phone on the ground.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Is something wrong?</div>
    <p id="nar">A DG mutant dog runs up to Vincent from behind; Vincent punches it away, stands up, and growls.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent!</div>
    <p id="nar">He regains his composure; he still hasn't transformed.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">What's going on?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Why is Chaos...? Why now?</div>
    <p id="nar">Scene changes back to Shelke.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">You really don't know, do you?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">The Protomateria helped you control Chaos. Now that you've lost it your mental state has become extremely unstable.</div>
    <p id="nar">Back to Vincent.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Protmateria? Control Chaos?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Yes. If you recall, you had it extracted from your chest by Rosso.</div>
    <p id="nar">Scene changes back to Shelke; while we see her lips move, it's Lucrecia's voice we hear.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Chaos. While a part of you, the entity exists independently from the rest of your body.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Shelke?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Chaos. The harbinger of anarchy.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent turns around. He seems an image of Lucrecia, standing there.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia.</div>
    <p id="nar">She begins to walk toward him, and speaks in synch with Shelke.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke/Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Born before the planet dies, he shall gather together all life for Omega's journey to the sea of stars. That is Chaos. And he slumbers inside you.</div>
    <p id="nar">The camera pans away; we see Vincent is looking at nothing, and Lucrecia is just a hallucination.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm so sorry.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">You must fight him. I don't want you to die... <em>[She disappears]</em></div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia!</div>
    <p id="nar">Scene change back to Shelke.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">You must fight him.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't want you to die.</div>
    <p id="nar">Her helmet malfunctions; sparks fly everywhere; she takes it off, while we see a red alarm blaring in the distance.</p>
    <p id="nar">Back to Cid at the helm of the Shera.</p>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Hey! Engine room! What the hell's going on down there!?</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Engine room! Dammit!</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">What is wrong?</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Don't have a damn clue. All of a sudden, engine levels began dropping like crazy.</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">We haven't taken any direct hits, so everything should be running like clockwork.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I will go have a look.</div>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">Thanks. Counting on you.</div>
    <p id="nar">She nods, and sprints to the engine room. Upon entering, she sees clouds of black energy throughout the room. An engine or two is on fire.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">It can't be.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Fancy meeting you here, Shelke.</div>
    <p id="nar">She turns around to face him.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">You.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Quite unexpected.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Why did you come here, Nero?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Why? I was short a few souls, and came to collect.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">What did you do with the crew?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog"><em>[laughs]</em> Need you ask? Look around. My mission is complete.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Oh...</div>
    <p id="nar">She turns around and sees a motionless Cait Sith on the ground. She turns to face Nero once more, and... takes out her weapon!</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">And what do we think we are doing?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I don’t really know.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">However, since coming here I have realized one thing--</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't want to let down anyone who's counting on me.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Pure nonsense.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Nonsense? Perhaps.</div>
    <p id="nar">Her weapon turns on. She attempts to hit Nero repeatedly, but he dodges or parries all her blows. Eventually he steps back, and his wings shift and fire bullets at Shelke, who puts up a shield to stop them. A black portal appears behind Nero... and the camera fades to black.</p>

    <p id="nar">Vincent makes his way through the familiar (though largely destroyed) lobby of the Shinra Tower, eventually finding the President's entrance to Deepground. He ventures further, eventually encountering... another Black Widow! Boss fight vs. Black Widow TW. Easily dispatched.</p>
    <p id="nar">Vincent continues on, eventually realizing he's a bit lost. He phones someone, but a "beep beep beep" implies the user is unavailable (as a result of Shelke's confrontation with Nero). He then receives a phone call.</p>
    <div class="speech tifa"><h4>Tifa:</h4><p id="dialog">Hey, I got through!</div>

    <div class="speech tifa"><h4>Tifa:</h4><p id="dialog">Of course he is, we're talking to him, aren't we? And do you really have to shout right next to my ear?</div>
    <div class="speech barret"><h4>Barret:</h4><p id="dialog"><em>[laughs]</em> Sorry 'bout that, Tifa!</div>
    <div class="speech tifa"><h4>Tifa:</h4><p id="dialog">I apologize, Vincent. Here's Cloud.</div>

    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Cloud. It's been a while.</div>
    <p id="nar">Camera does the fade-out/fade-in thing.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Cid's airship?</div>
    <div class="speech cloud"><h4>Cloud:</h4><p id="dialog">We lost contact about 15 minutes ago.</div>
    <div class="speech cloud"><h4>Cloud:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't think we have to worry, though. Those two should be fine.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Yeah. And what about you?</div>
    <div class="speech cloud"><h4>Cloud:</h4><p id="dialog">What do you think?</div>
    <div class="speech tifa"><h4>Tifa:</h4><p id="dialog">Right! You can count on us!</div>
    <div class="speech barret"><h4>Barret:</h4><p id="dialog">When I'm through, there won't be a single sucka standing!</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Right.</div>
    <div class="speech cloud"><h4>Cloud:</h4><p id="dialog">And as for you...</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent interjects.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Don't worry. Leave Deepground to me.</div>
    <div class="speech cloud"><h4>Cloud:</h4><p id="dialog">Can you hold on a second?</div>
    <div class="speech cloud"><h4>Cloud:</h4><p id="dialog">Tifa.</div>
    <div class="speech tifa"><h4>Tifa:</h4><p id="dialog">Got it!</div>
    <div class="speech tifa"><h4>Tifa:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent, I'm sending you a map of the Shinra Building.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent receives the map.</p>
    <div class="speech tifa"><h4>Tifa:</h4><p id="dialog">Deepground is below the complex. Take an elevator as far down as you can.</div>
    <div class="speech tifa"><h4>Tifa:</h4><p id="dialog">Good lu--</div>
    <div class="speech barret"><h4>Barret:</h4><p id="dialog">Give 'em hell, Vincent!</div>
    <div class="speech tifa"><h4>Tifa:</h4><p id="dialog">Barret, I thought I told you to--</div>
    <div class="speech cloud"><h4>Cloud:</h4><p id="dialog">Don't go getting yourself killed, now.</div>
    <p id="nar">They hang up; Vincent does the same, and moves on.</p>
    <p id="nar">So Vincent keeps going through the sprawling underground complex - this chapter is pretty thin on story. Eventually though, Vincent arrives at a large elevator that will lead him to the Deepground complex. And standing on this elevator is... Azul!</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">So Rosso didn't survive.</div>
    <p id="nar">Azul looks up and goes "Ohhh". Energy is emanating from Vincent's body.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Something inside you wants out.</div>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Its stench is so very familiar.</div>
    <p id="nar">Azul has a hearty laugh.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Come, Vincent! Show me your rage!</div>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Now, let the killing begin!</div>
    <p id="nar">He picks up his huge gun; the elevator begins to descend, as the Boss Battle vs. Neo Azul commences. After the battle, the gun is on the ground; Azul laughs.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">This is how a battle should be. Don't you think so?</div>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Now feel my true strength. Feel the wrath of Azul the Cerulean!</div>
    <p id="nar">Azul transforms into the beast from WRO HQ. Boss fight vs. Arch Azul, He gets defeated... but he's still in beast form after the battle! He charges forward and slaps Vincent, who hits the elevator's side railing hard.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Stand! This isn't over yet.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent stands.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Good. Now come and fight.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent zips in and punches Azul hard in his chest area. Bright light emanates from it.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Why you!</div>
    <p id="nar">A huge explosion blinds the screen. When the smoke clears, Chaos is standing there, and Azul is back in human mode.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Chaos?</div>
    <p id="nar">Chaos is holding Azul's gun. He launches it forward , and it pierces through Azul's stomach.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">It looks like you were more a beast than I.</div>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Very well. I'll see you again, Vincent... in hell!</div>
    <p id="nar">Chaos powers up, and shoots forward an energy blast that send Azul crashing through the railing, and off the elevator.</p>
    <div class="speech azul"><h4>Azul:</h4><p id="dialog">Hail Weiss!</div>
    <p id="nar">He tumbles down the endless abyss while laughing maniacally. Chaos roars; we see Nero has been watching this saga from above.</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">So that is Chaos. Intriguing.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">"Soul wrought of terra corrupt."</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Perhaps I should simply let him live out his destiny of destruction.</div>
    <p id="nar">Nero vanishes, but as he does he drops a cellphone. Chaos turns and looks at it.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm so sorry.</div>
    <p id="nar">Flashback; Vincent is inside the regenerative tube in Shinra Manor while Lucrecia looks over him.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent. Just a little longer. Then I can let you out.</div>
    <p id="nar">She turns around, then collapses on her knees.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">What's wrong with me lately? Maybe I've been working too hard.</div>
    <p id="nar">we see Hojo, and he gives off a "Hah!"</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">I thought I heard a rat down here.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">And just what do you think you're doing with my failed experiment?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Get out of my lab!</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Silence! I'm the one giving orders here!</div>
    <p id="nar">He approaches Lucrecia, and notices the computer screen behind her... then he goes "Ha ha ha"</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Omega? And Chaos?</div>
    <p id="nar">He turns to Vincent and laughs again.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">I see. Another experiment? You're using this fine specimen to finish your thesis, aren't you, Doctor?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">No. You're wrong!</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Am I? Once a scientist, always a scientist, I must say.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">How happy this fellow must be. Helping his beloved even after he's begun rotting away.</div>
    <p id="nar">Hojo laughs maniacally again as he walks away; Lucrecia buries her face in her hands and begins to cry.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">no. This is no experiment. It's...</div>

    <p id="nar">Vincent proceeds forward a bit; in the distance he notices a bunch of Gargoyles fly up to him. For a long time, Vincent makes his way throughout the Deepground complex/city, with no story developments; just a lot of dungeon crawling.</p>
    <p id="nar">Eventually, something of note happens; a whirlpool of black energy suddenly appears behind Vincent! He tries to run away, but it engulfs him; he's surrounded by darkness, and it completely swallows him. Somewhere in the darkness, a small blip of light appears and gets larger. A girl's voice is heard.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">No. Don't let Chaos control you.</div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">You cannot be contained by his darkness because a part of you was born from it.</div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Find yourself. Regain control.</div>
    <p id="nar">The darkness disappears from around Vincent; we see him jump out of the darkness cocoon that had enveloped him.</p>
    <p id="nar">Scene change; somewhere else in the darkness that Vincent had just escaped from, we see Shelke, encased in a blue ball of energy (most likely generated by her Shield materia.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">As old as he is, and still acting like a helpless child.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I can see why Lucrecia had such a difficult time.</div>

    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't know why I'm doing this.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I will die when my magic runs out, anyway.</div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Is this...?</div>
    <p id="nar">Shelke looks up and gasps.</p>
    <p id="nar">Scene change; we see the "girl" was Lucrecia. It's another flashback; it's a flashback to when she first discovered the cave that would later be known as "Lucrecia's Cave"; the crystal formation is there as well.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Is this the place you spoke of?</div>
    <p id="nar">An older man is standing beside Lucrecia. His clothes slightly resemble Vincent's current attire, though they're almost entirely black.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Man:</h4><p id="dialog">Yes. Deep within this grotto is where Chaos is destined to awake.</div>
    <p id="nar">Lucrecia runs towards the crystals & giggles.</p>

    <p id="nar">Scene change; we're in the laboratory of Shinra Manor, Grimoire is standing by Lucrecia's side as she works on the computer; a ball of dark energy appears to be festering inside one of the regenerative tubes.</p>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">Don't you think you are taking things a little too quickly?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">And why not? All those people at Shinra who laughed at my thesis... I have to prove them wrong!</div>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">Rushing into matters will get you nowhere, Doctor.</div>
    <p id="nar">Grimoire looks at the black ball of energy and goes "Hmm?" The black ball soon expands, filling the tube. Lucrecia gets up from her computer, as the energy cracks the tube.</p>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">Look out!</div>
    <p id="nar">Grimoire shoves Lucrecia out of the way, as the dark energy hits him in his right hand/arm. Lucrecia gets up and rushes to his side.</p>

    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">I'll be fine.</div>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">I'll be...</div>
    <p id="nar">Scene change; no idea where we are now (the background is black), but Grimoire is on his back and Lucrecia is by his side. His eyes are closed and green particles are floating upward from his body.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Dr. Valentine!</div>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">Tell my son that I'm sorry.</div>

    <p id="nar">He looks at her, as the green particle-evaporation quickens.</p>
    <div class="speech grim"><h4>Grimoire:</h4><p id="dialog">My time has come to return to the Lifestream.</div>
    <p id="nar">He disappears.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">No!</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">No! Come back! Why did you have to fade away!? Why did you...</div>
    <p id="nar">The camera pans out and we see Shelke is observing a crying Lucrecia.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">It's alright. He simply returned to the planet.</div>
    <p id="nar">Scene change; still clearly a flashback, someone is crying over a cross draped with flowers, though we don't see who... we just see the cross.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Stop crying, Shelke.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">But... But...</div>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">It's alright. Mom just returned to the planet. We'll see her again.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">We will?</div>

    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">(Is this...?)</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Of course we will.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">(No... Shalua?)</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Mom said everything in this world flows around in a circle. That means she'll come back someday.</div>
    <p id="nar">The younger Shelke stops crying.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Mom wouldn't lie to us, right?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Right.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Right.</div>
    <p id="nar">Back to the present, Shelke is still dreaming or hallucinating.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Shalua...</div>
    <p id="nar">Shalua appears beside her.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Shelke.</div>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Is it alright for me to return to the planet?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">No...</div>

    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Not yet. There's still so much I...</div>
    <p id="nar">Shalua pets her hair.</p>
    <div class="speech shalua"><h4>Shalua:</h4><p id="dialog">Don't worry. We'll see each other again.</div>
    <p id="nar">We see Shelke is still inside her cracked Shield; she wakes up.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">A dream?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">No... Data interference.</div>
    <p id="nar">One teardrop rolls down her cheek; then another on the other cheek. She wipes the first one away.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I didn't think I had any tears left.</div>
    <p id="nar">Back to Vincent, who's staring at the swirling dark energy he escaped from. He turns around and continues on: gameplay resumes, and he continues through Deepground's complex. Eventually he reaches a gateway, which puts him one step closer to Mako Reactor 0. But plumes of dark energy are scattered about, which can only mean...</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">A pleasure to finally meet you, Vincent.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Nero.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">At first, I thought you nothing more than a nuisance. However, it seems I can no longer let you run about unchained. I must protect my beloved brother.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Your brother?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Dear Weiss. Powerful Weiss. The only person who ever loved me. And the only person I will ever love.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">However...</div>
    <p id="nar">Nero hangs his head.</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog"><em>[Sighs]</em> But that is all forgotten. In a matter of moments, everything will change.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">What did you do with Shelke?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Shelke?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Ah yes, what did I do with her? I do recall running into the lass when I journeyed to the airship. A feisty one, she is.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">The girl is inside me, lost like a little puppy.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent lifts his gun, Nero goes "Ah"</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">So you wish to dance?</div>
    <p id="nar">Nero quickly draws both of his gun. You're thrown into a boss battle vs. Nero the Sable! A remarkably easy boss fight, too. Afterwards, Nero's on the ground; he gets up.</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Impressive. Perhaps Azul and Rosso never stood a chance against the mighty Valentine.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">But enough. I have other matters to attend to.</div>
    <p id="nar">Nero engulfs Vincent in darkness; the scene changes to Shelke, also in the darkness, with her cracked Shield-bubble losing strength.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">So this is the end.</div>
    <p id="nar">Someone is there; she looks up. It's Vincent!</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">I think you dropped this.</div>
    <p id="nar">Shows her her cellphone.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Unless you find something appealing about this place, I suggest we leave.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Let's go.</div>
    <p id="nar">She nods.</p>
    <p id="nar">Back on the battlefield, Nero is observing the darkness that he sent Vincent into. He begins to walk away, but out come Vincent & Shelke. Nero turns around.</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">I see.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Soul wrought of terra corrupt.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">My darkness would have no control over you, would it?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">So I must try a different dance.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">How about...</div>
    <p id="nar">He generates a large cloud of darkness behind him, but is quickly distracted as a shuriken hits the ground near his feet. We see Yuffie high above, sporting her "mysterious ninja" garb from the Shinra Manor.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Even in a world where fear and despair reign over the heavens, you must never forget--where there is shadow, there is always light!</div>

    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Back and ready for action!</div>
    <p id="nar">Awkward silence.</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">My brother calls.</div>
    <p id="nar">He turns around and disappears in his darkness. Vincent looks at Shelke, who's sprawled on the ground.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Are you alright?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I...</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't know.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Maybe I was dreaming.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Hey!</div>
    <p id="nar">Waves her hands.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Over here, guys!</div>
    <p id="nar">Trips due to the hand-waving; falls down hard. Vincent sighs.</p>
    <p id="nar">Scene change; inside some room of the Deepground complex. Apparently here they have regenerative tubes, because Shelke is presently in one. Yuffie is by Vincent's side.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Will you be alright?</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Yes.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Okay! Now, let me see if I've got this. You keep going, find Nero and Weiss, and smack 'em into next Tuesday.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">And while you're cleaning house, I sneak into the reactor and shut her down.</div>
    <p id="nar">Yuffie twirls.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Sounds like a plan.</div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">So, see ya around, Vince!</div>
    <p id="nar">She runs off. Vincent begins to walk away, but...</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine.</div>
    <p id="nar">He turns back to face her. The camera pans out, and we see a nearby computer terminal state "Discoverer" followed by "Grimoire Valentine"</p>
    <p id="nar">Flashback. Vincent walks into the laboratory in Shinra Manor.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia? Hello?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Anybody here?</div>
    <p id="nar">As he looks around, he sees a computer terminal that profile's Grimoire Valentine's Shinra bio.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Father?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Who's...!?</div>

    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">But it is. Why didn't you tell me you worked with my father?</div>
    <p id="nar">He reaches for her arm, she smacks his hand away.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Stop it! Just stop it!</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia...</div>
    <p id="nar">The background is now black; we only see Lucrecia and Vincent.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I... It was all my fault.</div>
    <p id="nar">We see Lucrecia and Vincent are now holding hands. She's on the verge of sobbing.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I didn't mean for your father to die. I couldn't... I'm so sorry.</div>
    <p id="nar">She starts to cry and runs away; Vincent just stands there.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">But I never blamed her. All I wanted was to see her smiling face.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">But after that day, the light left her heart.</div>
    <p id="nar">The camera pans away from Vincent. We see Lucrecia facing Hojo, as a light shines on him.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">So you've come to your senses and chosen me.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Yes, doctor.</div>
    <p id="nar">She hugs him.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">However, if she is happy, then I don't mind.</div>
    <p id="nar">Fade out on Lucrecia and Hojo embracing, and Vincent standing around like the lonely sorry bastard he is.</p>
    <p id="nar">Back to the present; Shelke's wakes up inside the tube.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Another dream?</div>

    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Why are you fighting this battle?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">To destroy Deepground and stop Omega's return.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">It's time that an end is put to this madness. Or at least, that is what I tell myself.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Though I'm not completely sure that's the reason.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Not sure. Neither am I.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">But, Vincent... I don't want to see the world end. I just don't want there to be any more pain.</div>

    <p id="nar">Vincent eventually gets to the bridge leading into the reactor. Before he can enter, though... a helicopter comes into view, with numerous Gargoyles sitting on it. Boss fight vs. Dragonfly PT. Easily defeated, like always.</p>

At the end of the battle, he plunges into a swirling lava pit below.... a stream of darkness shoots out, and Nero is back in his regular human form. Boss battle vs. Gorgonero; he gets defeated again.</p>
    <p id="nar">We're back in the room in the reactor. Nero clutches his stomach with one hand, and stumbles down the hallway to the room with Weiss.</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Weiss.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent follows him down the hallway; upon re-entering the room Weiss was in, he is now standing!</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Weiss. My beloved brother. It is time.</div>
    <p id="nar">Weiss stands around for a moment, then laughs heartily.</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Together at last. I won't leave you again. Never... Weiss...</div>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/68.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/69.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">Weiss looks at him, and then jabs his hand through Nero's stomach!</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Weiss?</div>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm finished with you.</div>
    <p id="nar">Weiss launches him across the room; he lands near where Vincent's standing; Weiss laughs again, and jumps forward; Vincent begins firing at him, but they bounce right off Weiss' body.</p>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">Your weapons are useless.</div>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">My body is one with Omega. Just as yours is with Chaos.</div>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">The difference being, Chaos is nothing more than a pawn whereas Omega is the ultimate Weapon that will lead this planet's soul to the stars.</div>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">There is nothing that can destroy me. Nothing.</div>
    <p id="nar">He laughs... not as much as before though.</p>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent Valentine. And so we meet again.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">What?</div>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">Still in the dark?</div>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">Three years ago, while I was still running about looking for Sephiroth, I took it upon myself to distribute my data-- <em>[points to his head]</em> my mind, my knowledge, my inner being, across the worldwide network.</div>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">And even though my body had died, and the world had been left in ruin, I survived in a virtual reality.</div>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">When the network was restored, the scattered data regrouped and I was reborn.</div>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">A neo-Reunion, you could say.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">You...</div>
    <p id="nar">Weiss laughs, but his voice begins to morph to someone else's entirely.</p>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">That's right, boy. It's me.</div>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">Hojo!</div>
    <p id="nar">An image of Hojo appears beside Weiss, moving as he does. We hear Weiss and Hojo speaking in unison.</p>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let us do this right.</div>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">Hello, Vincent. How long has it been? Three years?</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">You know, when I first read it, I thought that woman's thesis was utter nonsense.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">I couldn't believe some fabled beast from legend past had anything to do with your survival.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">However, three years ago when you transformed into Chaos right before my eyes, I must say I was shocked.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Who would have thought her theory was actually valid?</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">And so I began thinking. If Chaos exists, then so too must Omega.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">And if you could become one, then maybe I could become the other to traverse the cosmos in a blaze of glory!</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">It was the chance of a lifetime.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">But there was a problem. Only a strong shell could hold back Omega's might.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">And it could not be just anyone.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">You see boy, the reason you were able to play such a perfect host for Chaos was because my experiments had endowed you with a nearly indestructible body.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Thanks to me, you are standing here today.</div>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/70.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">Hojo laughs.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Now, where was I?</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">I attempted to perfect my body for Omega by injecting myself with Jenova's cells. However, that didn't go as I had planned.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">I failed to consider the fact that the cells might try to take over my mind and eat away at my soul.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">And so, as a safety measure, I came up with a brilliant plan to transmit my neurodata across the worldwide network.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">However, after completing this, I realized I still required a durable body. And that's when I remembered Deepground--home to the most powerful beings on this planet.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">I even found a willing assistant in the lad Nero here to help carry out my so-called rebirth.</div>
    <p id="nar">We see Nero's lying on the ground, dead.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Though never did he expect I would take control of his "beloved" brother's mind.</div>
    <p id="nar">Hojo superimposes his image onto Weiss' body, and emits another maniacal laugh.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">And thus, with a new body, I began my final experiment.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">If the Chaos within you was born of a tainted Lifestream, then the almighty Omega would be born of a pure one.</div>
    <p id="nar">The camera cuts out to the pool of mako below the reactor.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">So I had my minions gather up the "uncontaminated" to create a stream of refined mako, thus awakening Omega inside me.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Genius, I tell you. Pure genius. Pure genius.</div>
    <p id="nar">Back inside the reactor.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Only a scientist of my caliber is worthy to become one with Omega and leave this planet for the stars!</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Hojo, I've heard enough.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent points his gun at him and fires; the image of Hojo disappears; we see 3 bullets fired from Cerberus approaching Weiss; he pulls out his two swords which had been strapped to his back, and deflects them away. Vincent continues to fire and Weiss deflects some more. When Vincent goes to reload his gun, Weiss lowers one sword - there's a gun barrel on the inside edge of the sword, which he fires a bullet at Vincent, who dodges out of the way. Eventually he gets close enough to Vincent and kicks him down.</p>

    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">You're getting old, Vincent Valentine.</div>
    <p id="nar">Hojo/Weiss laugh.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">You just can't leave me alone, can you? Now, sit right there. I want you to see this.</div>
    <p id="nar">Weiss turns around.</p>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">And once I have absorbed the Lifestream...</div>
    <p id="nar">The mako energy glows.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Wait.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent stands up.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">This isn't over.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">So eager to die, are we?</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Very well. I wanted to test out this body before I began my journey, anyway.</div>
    <p id="nar">Boss battle vs. Weiss the Immaculate. Unlike all the bosses before this, Vincent gets his ASS KICKED. We next see Weiss standing over Vincent's body.</p>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">That wasn't much of a test.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent begins to glow.</p>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">Chaos.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent jumps forward; Weiss, standing perfectly still, punches him & sends him flying back.</p>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">You already tried that, Vincent.</div>
    <p id="nar">Camera cuts to Shelke inside her regenerative tube.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent.</div>
    <p id="nar">Back in the reactor, Vincent is on the ground, glowing sporadically. He stands up. Vincent and Weiss look at him; an image of Lucrecia also appears near Vincent; Shelke speaks through her, but we also hear Lucrecia's voice overlapping.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/73.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent. You cannot defeat this enemy by simply trying to overpower him.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Take control. Don't let Chaos rule you.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">You must rule Chaos.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">You can do it!</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Enough of this charade!</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Please, Vincent.</div>
    <p id="nar">She disappears.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">It looks like our Dr. Crescent has a friend.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">But she won't help you now, Vincent Valentine.</div>
    <p id="nar">Weiss fires an energy beam at Vincent; he deflects it with his hand, and begins to glow red. Hojo is shocked.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Why you!</div>
    <p id="nar">A demi-sphere of energy appears around Vincent and Weiss/Hojo.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Utilizing the Protomateria to draw forth Chaos while maintaining your human form!?</div>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/74.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/75.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">Weiss runs forward, the barrier is gone.</p>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">Interesting. Let's see what you are capable of.</div>
    <p id="nar">Weiss attempts to slash & stab Vincent repeatedly, who gracefully dodges all his blows, while continuing to glow red. Eventually Vincent jumps backwards.</p>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">But even with the power of Chaos, you won't be able to stop me--stop Omega.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Hojo.</div>
    <p id="nar">Hojo goes "Huh?"</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">I said I've heard enough.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">What!?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">It's time to end this. Right here. Right now.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">You insignificant fool!</div>
    <p id="nar">Boss battle vs. Weiss Empowered. This time it's for real - and this time, Vincent wins. Weiss is sent flying into a wall. Weiss is easy unconscious or dead; Hojo's image appears.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Why!? Why is Omega's power fading? Why?</div>
    Voice: Weiss.
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">What is going on?</div>
    <p id="nar">Nero ascends from a hole of darkness in the ground. He's got more darkness floating around him than before.</p>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Weiss.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Impossible!</div>
    <p id="nar">We're shown a clip of Weiss/Hojo killing Nero - or so we thought.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Get out of me!</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Omega's host must be pure!</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">Why do you think I had you create mako untainted by Jenova!?</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">If a filthy being like you infected it...</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Silence.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">What?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Silence! I'm speaking with my brother.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">You're what?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Dear Weiss...</div>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">Nero.</div>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">No!</div>
    <p id="nar">Nero crouches, and puts his hands on Weiss' shoulders.</p>

    <p id="nar">Nero hugs him.</p>
    <div class="speech weiss"><h4>Weiss:</h4><p id="dialog">Yes. Let us... Let us go join him.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Weiss...</div>

    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">No! Stop it! You can't! This is my body now!</div>
    <p id="nar">Hojo disappears; Weiss stands up and begins to walk towards his throne.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">No!</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent is just standing around.</p>
    <div class="speech"><h4>Girl:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent!</div>
    <p id="nar">He turns around, in runs Yuffie.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">We did it!</div>
    <p id="nar">The mako energy surrounding Weiss' altar blasts up; a stray blast heads towards Yuffie and Vincent; he pushes her out of the way, and it hits him.</p>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent!</div>
    <p id="nar">FMV: Outside Midgar, the war has lessened. Suddenly, the mako reactors spring to life. Far above Shinra Tower, three strands of mako energy coalesce, forming a large green ball. Eight smaller energy tentacles eject themselves from the ball, stabbing into the eight reactors. An object begins to form and take shape... it's Omega!</p>

    <p id="nar">The strands  of energy are still attached to him. Inside his body, Vincent transforms to Chaos, and breaks through Omega, flying high into the air. He dives down to attack him, but is prevented from doing so by some sort of invisible energy forcefield.</p>

    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Omega has awoken.</div>

    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Or so it would seem.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">However...</div>
    <p id="nar">Shelke walks over to a chair and sits in it. A machine above her moves into place.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">In theory, the souls that exist inside Omega should act as a type of virtual network.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">It wouldn't be impossible, but maybe I could...</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent, be grateful that I not only uploaded Lucrecia's thoughts, but her wishes and dreams as well.</div>

    <p id="nar">Back outside Omega now; a ball of energy bursts forth from the top of Omega's head. Black strands of energy reach it and attempt to hold it, but it breaks free.

    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Stop!</div>
    <p id="nar">A bright light shines from the ground. She looks at Chaos, then the ground: a materia is lying there, glowing. Screen fades to black.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">This... The materia...</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I found... We found together.</div>
    <p id="nar">Lucrecia is shown furiously typing at her computer. The screen flashes red once, then again a few moments later.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">No!</div>
    <p id="nar">She turns around; only Vincent's there. She falls to her knees.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">What am I doing?</div>
    <p id="nar">We see the following scene from Vincent's viewpoint, inside his tube. Lucrecia is grabbing Hojo by his shoulders and shaking him.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Give him back!</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Give my son back!</div>
    <p id="nar">She backs away.</p>
    <div class="speech hojo"><h4>Hojo:</h4><p id="dialog">And how is your experiment proceeding?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I don't know! I don't care!</div>
    <p id="nar">She cries, screen fades to black.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Let me see him! Just once!</div>
    <p id="nar">Brief pause, and then...</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm so sorry.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I can't...</div>
    <p id="nar">We now see Lucrecia is sitting on the ground, back against a console outside of Vincent's tube.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm sorry.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I can't take it anymore.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">My body... My mind...</div>
    <p id="nar">Screen fades to black.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Before I go...</div>
    <p id="nar">The following phrases flash on screen, one at a time.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Jenova's cells... Vincent... Stored as data... Must leave... Thought... I loved... Record.. Memory copy... For him... It was wrong... Wait... Disperse... ...so sorry... Apply... ...but I... For... Fragment... Survive... Hope... who...?</div>
    <p id="nar">Scene changes back to the Manor; Vincent is all alone in his tube; a door behind him opens, but we don't see who stepped out (or in)</p>
    <p id="nar">Another flashback; Shelke is standing around in a room in the Deepground complex. Nero is in front of her.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Who is she?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Dr. Lucrecia Crescent.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">So I am to collect the data files-- the fragments she left within the network?</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">Correct. Then you are to use that data to find the Protomateria.</div>
    <div class="speech nero"><h4>Nero:</h4><p id="dialog">That is where he requires your assistance.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">He...?</div>
    <p id="nar">Screen fades to black.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">That information is unnecessary.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Connect with her, Vincent. Connect with her heart.</div>
    <p id="nar">Dream/hallucination time: Vincent is sitting in her cave. An image of her descends and approaches him.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Hello Vincent.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Something's wrong...</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">You see, this is me, but only in a sense.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">It is merely a reflection created with my remaining data.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">The real me crumbled away long ago.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent. Do you remember our place? Under that tree?</div>
    <p id="nar">Scene changes; they're under the tree. Vincent's sitting in the same position as he was in the cave.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">The warm breeze on our skin...</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I know that it no longer exists.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Things fade with time, as do many things in this world.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">But there are some things that we cannot let disappear.</div>
    <p id="nar">She turns and faces him.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I finally...</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I finally realized my true feelings.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Even if you may never understand them.</div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent continues to sit there, looking down. He's been pretty much motionless the entire time. Lucrecia smiles and turns back around.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Not that I mind, though.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">But...</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">This isn't how it was supposed to be.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I've made too many mistakes.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">And I've hurt you so, so much.</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">Why did I do what I did?</div>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">I'm so sorry.</div>
    <p id="nar">Screen fades to black.</p>
    <div class="speech lucrecia"><h4>Lucrecia:</h4><p id="dialog">But I'm so happy you survived.</div>
    <p id="nar">Fade back in on the tree; Vincent is now standing up.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia!!!</div>
    <p id="nar">He closes his eyes. When he reopens them, he's flying in the air as Chaos; he dives to the ground. In the next scene, we see he's holding Shelke in his arms; apparently he went underground, got her, and brought her back to the surface. While he appears to be Chaos, he speaks like Vincent, though his voice is slightly distorted.</p>

    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Sorry about that.</div>
    <p id="nar">An image of Lucrecia appears above Shelke.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">Not that I mind, though.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">She... She was always like that.</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Only believing what she wanted to.</div>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">So Vincent, why don't you try telling her that yourself?</div>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Maybe I will.</div>
    <p id="nar">He reaches out with his right arm. A gun materializes out of thin air.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">But before that, I have a story to end.</div>
    <p id="nar">He flies up.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-container" class="content">
    <!-- Chapter 12 -->
    <div id="header"><span>Chapter 12: A Chaotic Finale</span></div>
    <p id="nar">Vincent/Chaos is standing on a platform, with Omega looming in the far distance. As you make your way across various platforms, Omega sends creatures to finish you off, but Chaos' Death Penalty takes them out with ease.</p>
    <p id="nar">Eventually, we see an FMV; Omega fires off some energy in an attempt to send Vincent backwards; however, suddenly, a Mako Reactor explodes! We see Cloud took a nice swipe at it, and tumbles downward, landing on his feet. He picks up his cellphone.</p>
    <div class="speech cloud"><h4>Cloud:</h4><p id="dialog">Sorry about the wait.</div>
    <p id="nar">Next, Tifa kicks a DG soldier, and picks up her phone.</p>
    <div class="speech tifa"><h4>Tifa:</h4><p id="dialog">Everything's clear over here!</div>
    <p id="nar">Barret fires his gunarm into the sky.</p>
    <div class="speech barret"><h4>Barret:</h4><p id="dialog">They're all yours now, Vincent!</div>
    <p id="nar">Cid coolly lights a cigarette. He's leaning on a metal grate, as a reactor collapses in the background.</p>
    <div class="speech cid"><h4>Cid:</h4><p id="dialog">All in a day's work.</div>

    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">When did I start caring so much about what happened?</div>
    <p id="nar">She turns around and looks up.</p>
    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">The rest is up to you.</div>
    <p id="nar">Scene cuts to Vincent, still flying in the sky above Omega. The streams of energy once connected to the reactors are now loose. We cut to quick shots of Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Cid, Reeve and Yuffie, and then show all of them, shouting "Vincent!" in unison.</p>

    <p id="nar">Vincent charges towards Omega at full power. We see his 6 teammates from FFVII once again, as they shout "Yeah!" in unison. Vincent slams into Omega's barrier and pushes his way through it, entering the giant Weapon. Vincent wrecks Omega on the inside, then ventures to its key area; a gorgeous world filled with water with clouds in the sky. Beneath the water is something, which Weiss appears to be ingrained in. Boss Battle vs. Crystal Feelers; when they get destroyed the underwater object ascends into the sky. Boss Battle vs. Omega Cocoon. Upon its defeat, the cocoon explodes.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/97.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/98.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">We see an image of Weiss, sword in each hand, walking towards Vincent/Chaos. He then speeds forward, but Vincent fires a blast from the Death Penalty, sending him flying backwards... yet an instant later, we see him behind Vincent, both his swords piecing his stomach. But THEN an instant after that, we see Vincent behind Weiss, pointing the Death Penalty at him.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/99.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/100.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">Weiss smirks and jumps into the air, and their flashy fight continues, like something you'd see in Dragonball Z. Eventually, Weiss laughs, and we see what had been inside the cocoon. Some huge... thing.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/103.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">It sends forth 4 feelers, which latch onto Weiss and pull him into... it.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/101.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/102.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>

    <p id="nar">Final Boss Battle vs. Omega Weiss. Upon its defeat, Weiss detaches and plummets. The creature gets absorbed into the ground.</p>
    <p id="nar">FMV. Omega becomes crystallized, and the crystal turns to stone, yet it continues to float above Midgar. His massive wings breaks through their stone prison, flapping fervently, as he lifts into the air. Vincent keeps pace with him.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/105.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/106.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>

    <p id="nar">Vincent soars past Omega, turns around and faces him as he approaches. The Protomateria in his chest is glowing brighter than ever. He lets out a howl, and plummets right into him. From space, we see a tremendous explosion cover a good portion of the planet... and the screen goes white.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/109.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/110.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">When it fades back in, we see the whiteness being to subside over Midgar. Cloud and the gang look upwards, as they can see the stars.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/111.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/112.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">The blackness of space soon turns to green, as the mako energy from Omega falls back to Earth, along with three globules of red energy.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/113.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/114.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <div class="speech yuffie"><h4>Yuffie:</h4><p id="dialog">Vincent?</div>
    <p id="nar">The credits begin to roll, as the red globules descend. We see Vincent's keychain dangling from a metal pole, perhaps implying he perished?</p>

    <p id="nar">The camera fades out on the keychain, as the credits continue to roll by. Towards the end of the credits, it fades back in on Midgar, and we see the tube Shalua is in. The glass is cracked, and her eyes remain closed... and sadly, they don't reopen.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/117.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"><img src="http://www.ffwa.eu/ff7/images/script-shots/118.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="177" width="250" class="imgpad"></div>
    <p id="nar">Of course, a Final Fantasy game wouldn't be complete without additional cutscenes after the credits. We see glimpses of Midgar on a beautiful day, as birds fly by. Shelke provides some voiceovers.</p>

    <div class="speech shelke"><h4>Shelke:</h4><p id="dialog">I've learned I must never give up hope. Never...</div>

    <p id="nar">Scene changes to Lucrecia's Cave; the present this time, not a flashback, dream or hallucination. She's encased in the crystals like always; Vincent is talking to her, while sitting in the same place he always sits.</p>
    <div class="speech vincent"><h4>Vincent:</h4><p id="dialog">Lucrecia.</div>

    <p id="nar">He turns around and walks away. A single teardrop roles down her cheek. Upon exiting the cave, he sees Shelke sporting some new, non-DG clothes.</p>

    <p id="nar">Midgar, after the destruction of Omega. In any underground cave, Weiss' body lies motionless on a slab of rock, his swords at his side. Suddenly, electricity fills the room... a body hovers in the air, enveloped in a ball of water. The ball glows orange; stalactites begin to fall from above. The ball explodes outwards, and the man lands. He moves towards Weiss, walking on water, momentarily standing above him before picking him up. The man is the mysterious being known as G, or </p>
    <p id="nar">Genesis. For more on G, read the G Reports!</p>

    <div id="header"><span>Omega Reports and G Reports</span></div>
    <p id="basic">There are 8 Omega Reports; the first 4 are found in Shinra Manor, with the last 4 spread out in the DG complex and on Omega itself. The first few appear to be written by Dr. Grimoire Valentine, with the latter few by Lucrecia herself.</p>
    <h4 id="reporthead">Discovery</h4>
        <div id="report"><center>- Ancient Table Discovered -
        <br/>
        <br/>Soul wrought of terra corrupt,
        <br/>Quelling impurity,
        <br/>Purging the stream.
        <br/>To beckon forth an ultimate fate.
        <br/>Behold mighty Chaos,
        <br/>Omega's squire to the lofty heavens.</center>
        <br/>
        <br/>After further study of the table by our research team, it has been determined that this passage was written by the Cetra over two thousand years ago.
        </div>
    <h4 id="reporthead">No New Findings</h4>
        <div id="report"><center>-Memo-</center>
        Could "Omega" be a place and "Chaos" a person? While our search of the site has continued, we have been unable to locate any new artifacts that may help us to answer our many questions.
        <br/><br/><center>-Promised Land-</center>
        Quite a few of my colleagues have come to the conclusion that Omega may be the fabled "promised land" to which legend states the Cetra are to lead us. However, I still have my doubts. If Omega were an actual location, then how could Chaos be its "squire to the lofty heavens"?
        <br/><br/>Next month, administration will finally be sending me the assistant I have been asking for. Rumor has it she graduated at the top of her university class.
        </div>
    <h4 id="reporthead">Alternate Theories</h4>
        <div id="report"><center>-Memo-</center>
        Review of several dated reports on our world's Lifestream have shed new light on my theories about the Cetra inscription. Just as we are born from the flowing matter below our feet, I now believe that Chaos and Omega may also be sentient life forms that the planet creates at its own will.
        <br/><br/>If we were able to discover the exact location where these two beings are to be born, the scientific repercussions would be enormous.
        <br/><br/>I was informed by a fellow paleontologist this morning that the company had discovered another Cetra artifact, and a new large-scale research project was scheduled to begin. She also said that my assistant had been offered a place on the team.
        </div>
    <h4 id="reporthead">The Terrasystem</h4>
        <div id="report"><center>-Memo-</center>
        The more I learn of this wondrous planet's inner-workings, the more I am in awe of that which lies before me.
        <br/><br/>Omega... Part of a system created by our world to preserve the constant circulation of life. And therein lies the key to solving this mystery... For many years it has been documented that local legends not only speak of this phenomenon in terms of a planetary scale, but also suggest that the entire cosmos may follow the same rules.
        <br/><br/>I must say, I am quite pleased with the work of my fine assistant. Her ardent approach to the tasks before her will most certainly lead us to the many answers which continue to elude our team.
      </div>
    <h4 id="reporthead">Omega and Chaos</h4>
        <div id="report">
        The two names which appear on the tablet...
        <br/><br/>If Omega is to act as the ark which guides all life to the boundless sea of stars...then what of Chaos?
        <br/><br/>The ancient inscription implies that his duty is to "beckon forth an ultimate fate." Perhaps it is he who is destined to lead us to Omega.
        <br/><br/>Soul wrought of terra corrupt...
        <br/> What message lurks behind these ominous words?
      </div>
    <h4 id="reporthead">Impurities</h4>
        <div id="report"><center>-Impurities in the Lifestream-</center>
        <br/>The spring that Dr. Valentine discovered is amazing! I am certain that it is some sort of reservoir for the "terra corrupt" mentioned on the Cetra tablet.
        <br/><br/>The doctor believes the crystalline spring contains contaminated deposits of bioplasma that have overflown from the pure Lifestream. In fact, all of our readings indicate a strange type of energy radiating from the site. Could this grotto be the location where the legendary Chaos is destined to be born?
        </div>
    <h4 id="reporthead">Chaos</h4>
        <div id="report">  My conscience tells me that I must leave some sort of record documenting all that I have attempted.
          <br/>That which slumbers within him...
          <br/>The antithesis of Omega... Chaos.
          <br/><br/>Soul wrought of terra corrupt...
          <br/>Before Omega begins his journey to the sea of stars, Chaos will scourge the world of all things living, sending them back to the Lifestream...
          <br/><br/>Only to be left with the burden of bearing the discarded remnants of a dying world.
          <br/><br/>And it was I who...
          <br/>I am so sorry...
        </div>
    <h4 id="reporthead">Protomateria</h4>
        <div id="report"><center>-Protomateria-</center>
        <br/>I have determined the materia found by Dr. Valentine at the fountain of Chaos to be a type of refined anti-matter formed within the grotto over the past several millennia.
        <br/><br/>I believe the planet created this instrument out of necessity as a means to control Chaos and prolong its own inevitable fate.
        <br/><br/>By controlling Chaos, the planet also succeeds in preventing the advent of Omega. If Chaos is allowed to fulfill his destiny of destruction, Omega's awakening cannot be far behind.
        <br/><br/>That is why I...

    <h2>G REPORTS</h2>
    <p id="basic">Who, or what, is G? His character is modeled after Japanese pop sensation Gackt, and Gackt did the voice acting for G in the Japanese release of the game (Robin Atkins Downes covered this role for the US release.) He is first mentioned by a member of the Shera, in a conversation you can easily miss (as it's entirely optional). The individual says the following:
    Deepground.
    <br/><br/>It used to be a medical facility for injured SOLDIER troops.
    <br/><br/>Military personnel would be sent there for care and rehabilitation.
    <br/><br/>However, over time, it evolved into a laboratory for madmen content on ignoring all laws of man and nature.
    <br/><br/>And supposedly, this evolution took place because of the existence of one rogue soldier--a man known only as "G."
    <br/><br/>The following are the three G Reports in the entirety, and some final thoughts on what they mean, and what we can expect from the man called G. The double line break in the 3rd report is as it appeared in the game - to emphasize the writer's claim that it is his final entry.</p>
    <h4 id="reporthead">Taboo</h4>
        <div id="report">The Shinra Company is feared across the globe for its ruthless army, SOLDIER.
        <br/><br/>However, there are two members of this legion of whom few have the courage to speak.
        <br/><br/>While one is well known: the infamous "S"
        <br/>--a symbol of strength and destruction--
        <br/>the other remains shrouded in an eldritch veil of shadows. All records of this man's existence have been deleted: the only remnant of his legacy being the lone letter "G".
        </div>
    <h4 id="reporthead">A Single Record</h4>
        <div id="report">"G"...
        We can only begin to imagine who this enigmatic warrior might be.
        <br/><br/>There are rumors that he was a biochemically constructed prototype for the soldier who would become "S". However, there are no documents to support these claims. In fact, there is so little information on "G" that his existence may be nothing but a fabrication.
        <br/><br/>The only thing that may give insight into this mystery is a lone personnel record which indicates that several years ago, a soldier 1st class was assigned a top-secret mission to pursue a target referred to only as "G". Unfortunately, any further data on this mission has been lost or destroyed...
      </div>
    <h4 id="reporthead">Below Midgar</h4>
        <div id="report">"G" slumbers below Midgar...
        <br/>Silently abiding his awakening...
        <br/><br/>Or so tell the stories of the vagrants who dwell in the slums of the mephitic metropolis. However, could there exist some truth behind these rumors?
        <br/><br/>Being one of the few who was involved in their construction, I know all too well of the vast caverns that sprawl deep beneath our city's streets.
        This will more than likely be my final entry. The last fragment of data I have uncovered reads as follows:
        <br/><br/>Soldiers branded with epithets of color...
        <br/>These are the hellspawn of "G".
        </div>
    <h2>Final thoughts:</h2>
    <p id="basic"><ul>
        <li>The Tsviets were the "hellspawn" of G (being Cerulean, Crimson, Sable and... Translucent.) It is most likely G who granted Nero the "knowledge of rebirth" (see: Chapter 11), and if that's the case, it could very well lead to Weiss' rebirth, judging by what occurs in the secret ending.</li>
        <li>It is worth noting that, in all appearances of Sephiroth (either as Safer Sephiroth, at the end of Advent Children, or in the Kingdom Hearts games) his wing appears on the right side of his body; G's wing is on his left side, insinuating a further connection between the two.</li>
        <li>"A Single Record" is a story that will almost surely be told in detail in Crisis Core, the next game in the Compilation of FFVII. The question is, whether the soldier 1st class will be Sephiroth, Zack, or Andeal (a new character, who apparently serves as Zack's mentor/superior)</li>
        <li>Apparently, according to online missions from the Japanese game, Hojo, Gast and Grimoire were behind the birth of G. Additionally, an online mission apparently reveals that the black substance which struck Grimoire (see: Chapter 10) was known as "G-substance". What is this substance, and what are its properties?</li>
        <li>Word on the street is that his name is Genesis (which would make sense, considering what he represents); of course, having not played the Japanese version of the game or the online missions myself, any references I've made to them should be treated as rumours or hearsay until verified!</li>
        <li>If G does get defeated in Crisis Core by the soldier 1st class, then how did he return? A being who could return from the Lifestream at will would be an eternal foe. Unless he didn't return to the Lifestream when he died, which would raise even more questions...</li>
      </ul>
    <p id="basic">All these unanswered questions allow some intriguing possibilities for a sequel to Dirge of Cerberus, or even a true sequel to FFVII, namely FFVII-2. G certainly seems to be a powerful enough, being the archetype of Sephiroth. But I suppose we'll find out in due time... that's enough speculation for now. Hope you enjoyed the script!</p>
